<h1>THE BOBBSEY TWINS AT CEDAR CAMP</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—FREDDIE’S SURPRISE</h2>
<p>
Very still and quiet it was in the home of
the Bobbsey twins. There was hardly a sound—that
is, of course, except that made by four
figures tiptoeing around through the halls and
different rooms.
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” suddenly exclaimed Bert Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” echoed his sister Nan.
</p>
<p>
They were two of the twins.
</p>
<p>
Again came the shuffling noise made by tiptoeing
feet on the front stairs.
</p>
<p>
“Quiet now, Flossie and Freddie!” whispered
Bert. “Go easy, and don’t make a
racket!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
</p>
<p>
He turned toward Nan, who was carrying
something in a paper that rattled because of
its stiffness.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you be quieter?” asked Bert.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t me—it’s this paper,” Nan answered.
“I should have taken some of the tissue kind.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish you had,” Bert went on. “But it’s
too late now. We’re almost there. As soon as
we get everything hidden it will be all right.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly there was a sound behind Bert and
Nan as though someone were choking. It was
followed by a smothered laugh.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Bert in a sharp whisper.
“Do you want to have everybody in the
house down here seeing what we’re doing?
Who did that?”
</p>
<p>
He spoke a bit sharply, in a tense whisper,
but his voice was not really cross. It was as
though Bert were the leader of some secret
band of soldiers or of Indians, and wanted
the men to do just as he had told them.
</p>
<p>
“Who did that?” he asked again.
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess I did,” answered the voice of
his little sister Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“What did you do?” asked Nan. “You must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
try to be quiet, dear, else our fun will be
spoiled. Better take sister’s hand.”
</p>
<p>
“Holdin’ your hand won’t do any good,” answered
Flossie, and though she tried to talk in
a whisper it was rather a loud one. “Your hand
can’t stop makin’ me sneeze,” Flossie went on.
“Can it?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, did you sneeze, dear?” asked Nan, who,
since she and Bert were “growing up,” felt
that she must take a little more motherly care
of Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I did sneeze,” Flossie answered. “An’
maybe I’ll sneeze more again. I feel so, anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you dare!” exclaimed Bert.
</p>
<p>
“She didn’t sneeze! Not a reg’lar sneeze!”
declared Freddie, who was carrying a cigar
box. Did I mention that Freddie and Flossie
were the other pair of Bobbsey twins? I
meant to, anyhow.
</p>
<p>
“If she didn’t sneeze, what did she do?”
asked Nan.
</p>
<p>
“I did sneeze!” insisted Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“You did not!” asserted Freddie. “You——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hush! Hush!” cautioned Bert. “You’ll
spoil everything!”
</p>
<p>
But Freddie was not to be shut off in that
way. He came to a stop in the hall, along
which the two pairs of twins were tiptoeing
their way through the house, and in the half-darkness,
for the light was turned low, he
pointed his fat, chubby forefinger at Flossie,
holding, the while, his cigar box under his
other arm.
</p>
<p>
“She did not sneeze—not a reg’lar, full,
fair sneeze!” he declared. “She put her hand
over her mouth an’ she choked, an’ she made
more noise ’n if she had sneezed. Guess I
know what she done!”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Did</em>, dear! <em>Did!</em>” corrected Nan. “You
must use right words now that you are in
regular classes at school and are out of the
kindergarten. <em>Did</em>—not <em>done</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Flossie <em>did</em> snort and she <em>did not</em> done
sneeze,” went on the fat little “fireman,” as
his father sometimes called him.
</p>
<p>
“I—I could ’a’ sneezed if I’d wanted to,”
said Flossie. “Only I’ve an awful loud sneeze,
I have. It’s louder’n yours, Freddie Bobbsey.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p>
“’Tis not!” declared Freddie. “You wait
till I tickle my nose, an’ I’ll sneeze an’ I’ll show
you! I’ll show you who can sneeze loudest!”
</p>
<p>
“No, you will not!” said big brother Bert
kindly, but firmly. “You two youngsters must
keep quieter, or we can’t do what we’re going
to do. Nan and I will take you back upstairs
and mother will make you go to bed! There!”
</p>
<p>
This was such a dreadful threat, especially
as Flossie and Freddie had been allowed to stay
up past their regular bedtime hour on their
promise to be good, that they at once quieted
down.
</p>
<p>
With Bert and Nan in the lead, the smaller
Bobbsey twins followed their older brother and
sister. Bert reached a door opening into a large
closet near the kitchen. It was in this closet
that the children were to hide the things they
were carrying, and why they were going to do
this you will soon learn.
</p>
<p>
But just as Bert was about to open the closet
door, Flossie gave a little wriggle, and, pulling
her hand away from Nan—the hand that did
not hold a package—the little Bobbsey girl
whispered:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
“It—it’s goin’ to be some more, Nan!”
</p>
<p>
“What is, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“My—my ker—snee——!”
</p>
<p>
The rest was a sort of gurgle, choke, and
cough mingled with a sneeze. Flossie had covered
her mouth and nose with one hand, and
thus tried not to make as much noise as she
otherwise would.
</p>
<p>
“Say! everything will be spoiled,” declared
Bert. “I never saw such children! We ought
to ’a’ made them hide their things this afternoon!”
</p>
<p>
“Flossie can’t help it,” said Nan kindly.
“Maybe she is catching cold. I must tell
mother to give her some medicine.”
</p>
<p>
“’Tisn’t cold,” declared Flossie. “It’s some
dust got up my nose. There was dust in the
closet where Freddie made me crawl to get
him a cigar box.”
</p>
<p>
“What did he want of a cigar box?” asked
Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tell!” cautioned Freddie. “You
promised you wouldn’t tell, Flossie Bobbsey!”
</p>
<p>
“All right, I won’t,” she promised. “Anyhow,
I don’t know, ’cause you didn’t tell me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
But I got him a box, an’ it was dusty an’ it
makes me sneeze an’——”
</p>
<p>
“That’s enough of this sneezing!” declared
Bert. “Let’s hide what we have and get out.
Dinah’s in the kitchen now, and if she hears
us scuffling around she’ll open the door and see
us and she’ll think something is going to happen.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, something <em>is</em> going to happen,” whispered
Nan, with a smile. But you could not
see the smile because it was rather dark in the
hall. “To-morrow is Dinah’s birthday, and,
oh! won’t she be surprised?”
</p>
<p>
“She’ll be more surprised,” said Freddie,
though neither Bert nor Nan knew just what
he meant just then. Later they did.
</p>
<p>
True enough, it was the birthday of Dinah
Johnson, the fat, jolly, good-natured colored
cook of the Bobbsey family, which included
the four twins. Dinah’s birthday was always
celebrated, especially by the twins, who always
brought out their presents as a sort of surprise.
</p>
<p>
This time they were bringing them down
from their rooms the night before the birthday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
to hide the things in a big closet near the
kitchen.
</p>
<p>
Thus the gifts would be ready the first thing
in the morning, to give to Dinah at the breakfast
table, when daddy would call her in from
the kitchen to be surprised.
</p>
<p>
It was Bert’s plan thus to hide the things
ahead of time, and Flossie and Freddie, of
course, had begged to be allowed to take part.
</p>
<p>
“I guess she didn’t hear anything,” said
Bert, after listening a moment, for Dinah was
still in the kitchen, finishing her day’s work.
“The door’s shut,” Bert added. “Now then,”
he went on, after a pause, “let’s hide our things
and go back upstairs. Pass yours to me, Nan.”
</p>
<p>
The older Bobbsey girl did so, and just as
Bert had put away his present and hers, there
was a loud sound behind him.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” sharply whispered Bert.
</p>
<p>
“It was Freddie,” answered Flossie. “An’
he didn’t sneeze—not at all.”
</p>
<p>
“I stumbled,” answered Freddie. “I’m
sorry!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s too late for that. But I guess
Dinah didn’t hear,” Bert said, listening a moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
“Pass me your present, Freddie, and
I’ll hide it with mine.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll hide it myself,” said the little fellow,
and he made his way to the closet, squirming
between Nan and Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, do as you please,” Bert agreed.
And thus it was that none of the others saw
Freddie put two packages in the closet instead
of one. One package was his regular present
for Dinah. The other was——
</p>
<p>
But just a moment, if you please. I want to
tell this story as it should be told.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, Freddie slipped two packages into
the closet without letting Bert see him. One
package was a cigar box, tied with a string, and
a queer scratching noise seemed to come from
within it.
</p>
<p>
“There! Now everything is hid,” said Bert,
when Flossie’s package had been put on the
shelf. “Now I’ll lock the door, for mother
gave me the key, and Dinah can’t open it. In
the morning we’ll give out the birthday presents.”
</p>
<p>
The Bobbsey twins thought that morning
would never come, but it did at last, and Dinah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
knew nothing of their secrets, they felt sure.
With eagerness the four children assembled at
the breakfast table.
</p>
<p>
“Call Dinah in, Daddy, and let us give her
the things,” begged Nan.
</p>
<p>
“I want to give mine first!” insisted Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“And me next,” said Flossie.
</p>
<p>
Fat Dinah came waddling in, her face all
smiles.
</p>
<p>
“I ’clar to goodness! Whut’s gwine on
now?” she asked. “Did I forgots to make de
coffee, or am de toast burned?”
</p>
<p>
Dinah pretended to be very much alarmed,
but I think she knew why she had been called
in. At least she knew something of what was
going to happen, but not all. She must have
known it was her birthday, and the children
always gave her something on such occasions.
</p>
<p>
“Dinah, please sit down a moment,” said
Mr. Bobbsey, trying not to smile. “I think
Freddie has something to say to you.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I got something to give you, Dinah!”
cried the little fellow, hurrying out to the closet,
which Bert had unlocked.
</p>
<p>
“Bress yo’ heart, honey lamb! Has yo’ got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
suffin’ fo’ ole Dinah?” she asked with a kind
smile.
</p>
<p>
“You—you’ll be s’prised,” said Freddie, as
he handed the fat black cook a cigar box, tied
with string.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Freddie!” exclaimed Nan. “That
isn’t your present! Yours is wrapped in blue
paper. Don’t you remember? I wrapped it
up for you.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll give Dinah <em>that</em> present in a minute!”
said Freddie, his eyes shining. “I have <em>two</em>
for her!”
</p>
<p>
“Bress his heart!” murmured the cook, as
she fumbled with the string.
</p>
<p>
A moment later it came off, and as the cover
of the box flew open out jumped a fat little
gray mouse!
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! Oh, mah good lan’!” screamed
Dinah. “Oh, a mouse! A mouse!” and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she knocked
over the chair on which she had been sitting.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—LOCKED UP</h2>
<p>
“Get him! Get him!” cried Bert Bobbsey,
making a dive for the little mouse.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t let him come near me!” screamed
Nan, as she left her seat and hurried over
toward her mother.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey. “To
be frightened at a poor little mouse!”
</p>
<p>
The mouse ran under one chair after another,
and circled around beneath the dining
room table.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Snoop?” cried Bert, stooping down
to watch which way the mouse ran. “Get
Snoop in to catch the mouse!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let him get me!” begged Flossie, and
she ran over to Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Children, be quiet!” commanded Mr. Bobbsey. “All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
this excitement over a little mouse!
Freddie, you did very wrong to put a mouse
in a box and give it to Dinah for a birthday
present!” and he spoke rather sternly to the
little fellow.
</p>
<p>
“Am dat mouse mah birfday present?” asked
the fat cook, who was huddled against the wall.
“If it is I don’t want it nohow!”
</p>
<p>
Isn’t it queer how frightened some women
and girls are of a mouse? I wonder why that
it is? Anyhow, Nan, Flossie and Dinah seemed
much frightened, while Bert was more interested
in seeing which way the little gray creature
ran.
</p>
<p>
“Get Snoop! Where is Snoop?” asked Bert,
calling for the family cat. “Snoop will love to
chase this mouse!”
</p>
<p>
“I help you catch my mouse for Snoop!”
offered Freddie.
</p>
<p>
He had stood, eagerly waiting, to see what
would happen when Dinah opened his extra
present box. And enough had happened to
satisfy even fun-loving Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Here, I’ll fix that mouse!” cried Mr. Bobbsey.
“Let it alone, Bert. I’ll drive it out!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bobbsey picked up a small open glass
salt dish from the table, and was about to throw
it at the mouse under the table.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t do that,” said his wife.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked Mr. Bobbsey, holding the
salt dish in readiness.
</p>
<p>
“Because you’ll spill the salt and it will have
to be cleaned up.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get the mouse!” cried Freddie. “I’ll
get him!”
</p>
<p>
He ran over to the goldfish tank in one corner
of the room. On the table on which the
tank rested was a tiny net of cloth on a handle
and wire frame. Bert used the net to lift out
the fish when he wanted to clean the tank, which
he intended doing that day.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll catch the mouse under this!” cried
Freddie, grabbing up the little net and trying
to dive under the table. But the little fellow
slipped, and knocked over a chair. It happened
to fall on Flossie’s foot. Instantly the small
Bobbsey girl set up a cry.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh, Freddie Bobbsey! Now look
what you did! My toenails is all broken! Oh!
Oh!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hush! Hush!” begged Mother Bobbsey,
hugging Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mah good lan’!” exclaimed Dinah, “I
neber did see such a birfday as dish yeah!
Nebber in all mah born days!”
</p>
<p>
Bert caught up his aluminum napkin ring
and threw it across the room as the mouse
made a dart toward the door leading into the
kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“There he goes!” cried Bert. “No use getting
Snoop now!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m glad the creature is out of the
way!” said Mrs. Bobbsey, with a sigh of relief.
“Now, Freddie, what possessed you to
do a thing like that—to give Dinah a mouse
for her birthday?”
</p>
<p>
“And where did you get it?” asked Bert. “I
should think you’d be afraid of it, Freddie.”
</p>
<p>
“He was in the box, and I shut the cover
down quick—like that”—Freddie clapped his
hands together—“and I ketched him.”
</p>
<p>
“You should say ‘caught,’” murmured Nan.
“Your teacher wouldn’t like to have you say
‘ketched,’ Freddie.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I—I got him, anyhow,” Freddie went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
on. “An’ I tied some string around the box
and I kept the mouse and I thought maybe
Dinah would laugh an’—an’——”
</p>
<p>
Freddie looked around the room. All too
much had happened from his little surprise.
The whole place was in confusion.
</p>
<p>
“If dey is any mo’ birfday presents like <em>dat</em>,”
said Dinah, “I reckon I better go!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no!” exclaimed Nan. “Mine is a nice
one, Dinah!”
</p>
<p>
“So’s mine!” echoed Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“An’ I’ve another!” added Freddie. “I’m
sorry I scared you, Dinah.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll forgive you this time,” said his
father. “Bring out the other presents now.”
</p>
<p>
And while this is being done I will take just
a moment to tell my new readers something
about the children who are to be the main characters
in this story.
</p>
<p>
If you have read the first book of this series,
called “The Bobbsey Twins,” you have learned
that Mr. Bobbsey had a lumber business in the
eastern city of Lakeport, on Lake Metoka.
Bert and Nan were the two older twins. They
had dark brown hair and brown eyes and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
rather tall and slim. The younger Bobbsey
twins were Flossie and Freddie. They were
somewhat short and stout, and had light hair
and blue eyes. The children had many good
times together and with their playmates, Grace
Lavine, Charlie Mason, Dannie Rugg, Nellie
Parks and Ruth Nelson. They also had fun
with Snoop, their pet cat, and with Snap, their
dog.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of books coming between
the first volume and the one just before this.
The Bobbsey twins went to the country to visit
Uncle Daniel, and at the seashore they stayed
with Uncle William. Besides these trips the
four children made a voyage on a houseboat,
visited a great city, camped on Blueberry Island,
went to Washington, and made a trip at
sea. They had, a week or so before celebrating
Dinah’s birthday, returned home after some
exciting times out West.
</p>
<p>
You may read about these last adventures
in the book just before this present volume. It
is called “The Bobbsey Twins in the Great
West,” and it tells how Bert, Nan, Flossie and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
Freddie helped solve a strange mystery about
an old man.
</p>
<p>
It was now fall, and on their return from
the West the Bobbsey twins had started to
school again. Bert and Nan had gone into a
higher grade, and Flossie and Freddie, though
they were still the babies of the family, were
now somewhat advanced at school, and were
in regular classes, attending morning and afternoon,
instead of going just in the morning, as
they had done while they were still in the kindergarten.
</p>
<p>
One of the first affairs the Bobbsey twins
had taken part in since their return from the
West had been Dinah’s birthday celebration.
Each of the children had bought the cook, of
whom they were very fond, a present, but
Freddie had provided an extra one, as we have
seen.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t ever do it again, Freddie!” cautioned
his father, when quiet had once more settled
over the household.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t, Daddy,” he promised.
</p>
<p>
“Then you may give Dinah her regular present,”
said Mother Bobbsey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
Freddie handed the cook a package wrapped
in blue paper.
</p>
<p>
“Is yo’ suah dey isn’t no mouse in dis?”
asked Dinah, pretending to be frightened.
</p>
<p>
“No mouse!” Freddie assured her. “You
open it!”
</p>
<p>
And when Dinah had done so she found a
bottle of perfume, which, she declared, was
“jest de sweetest kind what ebber was!” It was
exactly what she had wished for, she said.
</p>
<p>
Then the other presents were given to her.
Nan’s was a pocketbook, and Bert’s a pair of
comfortable slippers. Flossie handed Dinah a
gay, red silk handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
“An’ when I puts pufume on <em>dat</em>, an’ walks
out, everybody’ll be wishin’ dey was me!” declared
the fat, black cook. “Dish suah am a
lovely birfday!”
</p>
<p>
There were presents, also, from Mr. and
Mrs. Bobbsey, and when she had admired everything,
and thanked them all, Dinah finished
bringing in the breakfast. They all laughed at
Freddie’s mouse, and he told how he had caught
it.
</p>
<p>
He had had some nuts in a cigar box, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
the day before, coming softly up to it, he had
seen a little mouse nibbling away among the
nuts and shells. As quick as a wink Freddie
clapped the cover down, and had caught the
mouse fast. Then, without saying anything
to anyone about it, he had given it to Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, Bert, or we’ll be late for school!”
called Nan, as she finished her breakfast.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be right with you,” her brother answered.
“If Charlie Mason calls tell him to
wait. He and I are going fishing this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
“Can I come?” asked Freddie. “I’ll help
dig worms.”
</p>
<p>
“Not now,” Bert answered. “Maybe to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“You wait for me, Freddie!” called Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’ll wait,” he promised.
</p>
<p>
Soon the Bobbsey twins were on their way
to school. Bert walked with Charlie Mason
and Dannie Rugg, while Grace Lavine and
Nellie Parks strolled along with Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Did you bring your skipping rope?” asked
Grace of Nan. Grace was very fond of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
fun, though once she had jumped too much
and had been taken ill.
</p>
<p>
“No, I didn’t bring it,” Nan answered. “I
brought a new bean bag, though, and we can
play that at recess.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’ll be fun!” cried Nellie.
</p>
<p>
Bert and Charlie were talking about the best
place to go fishing. And the younger Bobbsey
twins were talking about something else.
</p>
<p>
“If he does it again to-day, you tell me an’
I’ll fix him,” said Freddie to Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“I will,” his golden-haired sister answered.
“Will you make him stop, Freddie?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure I will! You come and tell me!”
</p>
<p>
“What is it you are going to do?” asked Nan
of her smaller brother and sister. But just
then the warning bell rang and they all had to
run so they would not be late, and Nan forgot
about what she had overheard.
</p>
<p>
At recess there were jolly times in the school
playground. Some of the boys got up a baseball
game, and others played marbles, leapfrog
or mumble-the-peg. The girls skipped rope or
tossed bean bags, while some played different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
kinds of tag. It was cool, so that running about
and jumping made one feel fine.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly from the lower end of the playground,
near the shed where the janitor kept
his brooms, a lawnmower, and other things,
came a cry of alarm.
</p>
<p>
“That’s Flossie!” exclaimed Nan, pausing in
the midst of a bean bag game. “Something’s
the matter!”
</p>
<p>
She caught sight of Flossie and Freddie in
some sort of a battle with Nick Malone, one of
the “bad” boys of the school. Flossie and
Freddie seemed to be having a fight with Nick.
</p>
<p>
However, the battle was soon over. Before
Nan reached the scene or could call to Bert to
come to her help, Nick disappeared, and Flossie
and Freddie, each laughing, ran over to the
other side of the yard.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I guess they are all right,” said Nan,
as she stopped running and turned back.
</p>
<p>
Then the bell rang to call the children in
from their play, and they took their places in
long lines. A little later Bert and Nan were
in their room, saying their lessons, and Flossie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
and Freddie were with their classmates, getting
ready to recite in geography.
</p>
<p>
Miss Snell, their teacher, looked over the
room. She noticed one vacant seat.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Nick?” asked Miss Snell. “He
was here before recess. Did anyone see him
go home?”
</p>
<p>
No one answered for a moment, and then
Flossie raised her little, fat, chubby hand.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Flossie, what is it?” asked Miss Snell,
with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Nick didn’t go home,” said the little girl.
“He—he’s out in the yard.”
</p>
<p>
“Out in the yard?” exclaimed the teacher.
“He should come in!”
</p>
<p>
“If you please, he can’t,” said Freddie suddenly.
“He’s locked up! I locked him up!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—THANKSGIVING</h2>
<p>
Miss Snell was not quite sure that she understood
Freddie Bobbsey. She looked at the
little twin, smiled to make him understand that
she was not cross, and said:
</p>
<p>
“What did you do to Nick, Freddie?”
</p>
<p>
“I locked him up,” Freddie answered. “In
the tool shed. I have the key, too,” and,
marching up to Miss Snell’s desk he laid on it
a large key.
</p>
<p>
“You locked Nick in the tool shed!” repeated
the surprised teacher. “Why, Freddie
Bobbsey! what a strange thing to do. Why
did you do it?”
</p>
<p>
“He pulled my hair,” Flossie explained. “I
mean Nick did. He pulled it yesterday, too,
and I told Freddie and Freddie said he would
make Nick stop.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, go on, please,” urged Miss Snell, as
Flossie grew silent.
</p>
<p>
“Well, when he pulled it again to-day,” resumed
the little girl, “I hollered for Freddie
and we hit Nick and he hit us and we pushed
him into the shed and—and——”
</p>
<p>
“I locked the door!” finished Freddie. “You
can hear him hollerin’ to get out,” he added.
“Listen!”
</p>
<p>
The windows had been opened to freshen
the air in the classroom, and as silence followed
Freddie’s last remark Miss Snell and the
children could plainly hear, coming from the
shed, the voice of someone calling:
</p>
<p>
“Let me out! Let me out!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s Nick,” calmly explained Freddie.
“But I’m not going to let him out ’cause he
pulled Flossie’s hair.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, of course, he shouldn’t do that,” said
Miss Snell. “But you should not have locked
him in, Freddie. I shall have to tell the principal
and get him to let Nick out.”
</p>
<p>
The eyes of Flossie and Freddie grew big
as the teacher said this. The eyes of the other
children opened wide also. To have to tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
“the principal” anything meant that it was
very serious.
</p>
<p>
“But I am sure you did not mean to do
wrong,” Miss Snell added, as she saw that
Freddie and Flossie looked rather frightened.
“It will be all right, I’ll have the principal let
Nick out. You may look over your geography
lesson while I am gone. I want you to tell
me, when I come back, what is a river, a lake,
and an island.”
</p>
<p>
“We know about a island,” said Flossie in
a loud whisper. “Once we camped on Blueberry
Island, didn’t we, Freddie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep!” he answered. “An’ I fell in!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you may tell us about that later,” and
Miss Snell tried not to laugh. “But don’t talk
any more in school; and study your lesson
while I go to Mr. Nixon’s office.”
</p>
<p>
While Miss Snell was out of the room I do
not believe much studying was done by Flossie,
Freddie or any of their classmates. They all
listened as, through the open window, came
the cries of Nick Malone calling:
</p>
<p>
“Let me out! Let me out!”
</p>
<p>
“I locked him in—’cause he pulled Flossie’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
hair!” declared Freddie, and Freddie was
looked upon as quite a hero by the boys and
girls in his room.
</p>
<p>
By standing up, Flossie, Freddie and the
others in their class could see the tool shed.
And the children stood up and looked out as
Miss Snell and the principal went to release the
locked-up boy. He came out crying, and
seemed frightened. But he soon quieted down,
and promised never again to pull Flossie’s hair,
while Freddie was made to promise never again
to lock anyone in the tool shed.
</p>
<p>
“Tell your teacher, or tell me, when anyone
plagues your sister, Freddie,” the principal
said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m—I mean yes, sir,” Freddie answered.
</p>
<p>
Neither he nor Flossie had any more trouble
with the “bad” boy, about whose teasing they
had talked on their way to school that morning.
I think, after being locked up, that Nick
was afraid of Freddie. At any rate, Flossie’s
hair was not again pulled.
</p>
<p>
“Our smaller twins are growing up,” said
Mr. Bobbsey to his wife at home that night,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
when the story of what had happened in school
had been told at the supper table.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Mrs. Bobbsey. “Our little
‘fireman’ and our ‘fat fairy’ will soon be almost
as big as Bert and Nan.” Fireman and fairy
were the pet names for the smaller Bobbsey
twins. But they were getting almost too old
for pet names now.
</p>
<p>
The weeks passed, and the weather grew
colder, though, as yet, no snow had appeared.
Freddie and Flossie, who had gotten out their
sleds soon after coming home from the West,
looked at the sky anxiously each day.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think it will ever snow?” asked
Flossie of her mother. “I want to go coasting.”
</p>
<p>
“So do I, and skating, too,” Freddie added.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, there is still plenty of time for it to
snow this winter,” said their mother. “Why,
it isn’t Thanksgiving yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s so!” exclaimed Freddie.
“Thanksgiving is coming, an’ we’ll have cranberry
sauce an’ turkey!”
</p>
<p>
“An’ pie an’ cake!” cried Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Thanksgiving is not meant only for feasting,”
said their mother. “It is a time for being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
thankful for all your blessings. It is a time,
also, to think of the poor, and to try to help
them.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could help some poor,” said
Flossie. “Is it fun, Mother?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t know that you would call it
fun,” her mother replied, with a smile, “though
it gives more pleasure than many things that
you do call ‘fun’. Just try it and see.”
</p>
<p>
Rather thoughtful, Flossie and Freddie went
out together. It was the Saturday before
Thanksgiving and they did not have to go to
school. They each had two cents to spend,
and it was while going down the street to the
nearest candy store that they passed the home
of Miss Alicia Pompret.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Bobbsey twins!” called Miss Pompret
to Flossie and Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” answered the blue-eyed little boy
and girl. They knew Miss Pompret quite
well, since Bert and Nan had, on their trip to
Washington, discovered some of the elderly
lady’s missing valuable china. Miss Pompret
was what some people would call “rich,” and
she had offered a reward for the finding of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
her rare sugar-bowl and milk-pitcher. It was
these pieces that Nan had, by chance, seen in
a secondhand store window, and Miss Pompret
paid the older Bobbsey twins the reward, which
they turned in to charity.
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to the store for your
mother?” asked Miss Pompret of Flossie and
Freddie, as they paused at her door.
</p>
<p>
“We’re going to the store for ourselves,”
Freddie answered.
</p>
<p>
“We have two cents apiece,” added his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I see!” laughed the elderly, maiden
lady. “Well, on your way would you mind
stopping at the grocer’s and telling him he
hasn’t yet sent the barrel of flour, the barrel
of potatoes, and the ten hams I ordered. Tell
him I expect them to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“My! you’re gettin’ a lot of stuff, Miss
Pompret,” said Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see, I am going to give a large
dinner to a number of poor people for Thanksgiving,”
said Miss Pompret, “and I want some
things for them to take home with them.
That’s why I’m ordering so much.”
</p>
<p>
“For the poor!” murmured Freddie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear,” went on the lady. “You know
Thanksgiving is not meant to see how much
we can eat, but to think of our blessings and
help other persons to have blessings that they
may be thankful for.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what mother said,” remarked Flossie.
“Yes’m, we’ll stop at the grocery for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” called Miss Pompret.
</p>
<p>
Then, as she and Freddie walked on, Flossie
turned to her brother and said:
</p>
<p>
“Freddie, didn’t we ought to do something
for the poor?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we ought,” he agreed. “But who is
poor?”
</p>
<p>
“Anybody that has ragged clothes is poor,”
observed Flossie. “We could give ’em some
of our clothes, ’cause I’ve got so many my
closet is full.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve two pair of pants,” observed Freddie.
“I don’t need but one, I guess. But you can’t
eat clothes, Flossie.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it, but you have to have clothes
when it’s cold. And it maybe will snow for
Thanksgiving. Oh, Freddie! we could give
our two cents to somebody poor for Thanksgiving!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
Flossie’s eyes were shining with delight.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we could do that,” said Freddie,
slowly. “But you can’t get much clothes for
two cents and not much to eat, I don’t guess.”
</p>
<p>
Flossie thought this over for a moment, and
then her face lighted up.
</p>
<p>
“I know what we can do!” she said. “We
can look for some poor ragged people, and take
them to our house for Thanksgiving. Mother
or father could give them some clothes and
they could have some of our turkey. Daddy
and mother have some dressings, too, like Miss
Pompret said.”
</p>
<p>
“She didn’t say ‘<em>dressings</em>,’” objected Freddie.
“It’s ‘<em>blessings</em>,’ like you get in Sunday-school.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said Flossie. “Well, we could get
some for the poor. Let’s do it, Freddie.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed the little fellow.
</p>
<p>
They were just going into the candy store,
having stopped at the grocer’s with the message
from Miss Pompret, when Flossie and Freddie
caught sight of a ragged boy and girl, about
their own age, standing with their faces close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
against the glass of the show window of the
toy and candy shop.
</p>
<p>
“Freddie, look!” whispered Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“They’re poor!” whispered Freddie. “Let’s
take them!”
</p>
<p>
Flossie nodded in agreement, and then they
went up to the ragged children who were
eagerly gazing in the window, which was partly
filled with Christmas toys.
</p>
<p>
“Come on with us,” said Freddie, tapping
the other boy on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
Quickly the boy turned, doubled up his fist,
and, thrusting the ragged girl behind him, he
exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Now you let us alone! We wasn’t doin’
nothin’! We was just lookin’ in the winder,
an’ that’s what it’s for! You let us alone!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—BERT IN DANGER</h2>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie were so surprised at
the strange action on the part of the ragged
boy that they hardly knew what to do. Flossie
looked at Freddie and Freddie looked at his
sister, and then they looked at the strange boy
and girl.
</p>
<p>
“You let her alone, an’ you let me alone!”
ordered the ragged boy. “I ain’t done nothin’,
an’ she ain’t done nothin’!”
</p>
<p>
“You shouldn’t say ‘ain’t,’ ’cause it ain’t—I
mean it <em>isn’t</em> a good word. Our teacher says
so,” Flossie quickly admonished the strange
boy.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t care what I say, you oughtn’t
to drive us away from lookin’ in this winder,”
objected the boy. “Nice smells comes out; and
when you ain’t—I mean when you <em>isn’t</em> got
any money to buy candy, you can smell it!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie looked at each other in
surprise. To be so poor that one had to “smell”
candy instead of eating it, was to be poor indeed!
Flossie opened her fat chubby hand and
looked at the two moist pennies clutched there.
Freddie did the same. Then the small Bobbsey
twins, with one accord, held out the money to
the boy and girl.
</p>
<p>
“Here,” said Freddie. “Take it!”
</p>
<p>
“Mine too!” added Flossie. “You can buy
candy with it!”
</p>
<p>
For a moment the ragged boy and girl did
not know what to say. Then a smile came over
the boy’s face. His fist unclenched, and his
sister smiled too.
</p>
<p>
“You mean this—for us?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” answered Freddie. “We don’t need
candy, and we’ll feel good for Thanksgivin’!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m going to buy two lollypops!” cried
the ragged girl.
</p>
<p>
“I want gum!” said the boy, and into the
store they disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Freddie drew a long breath.
</p>
<p>
“I—I feel happy, don’t you?” he asked
Flossie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she answered. “I—I guess I do!
Anyhow, we can ask mother for more pennies
when we go home.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s take them home for Thanksgiving,”
suggested Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“You mean that ragged boy and girl?” asked
Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Miss Pompret is going to feed some
poor, and we can feed some at our house.
Let’s take ’em home,” went on Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that will be fine!” Flossie agreed.
“Let’s!”
</p>
<p>
When they came out of the candy store the
ragged boy and his sister, who at first thought
Flossie and Freddie had wanted to drive them
away from the window, were smiling.
</p>
<p>
“You’re coming home with us!” announced
Freddie, taking the boy’s hand.
</p>
<p>
“For Thanksgiving,” added Flossie. “Course
it isn’t Thanksgiving yet, but we want to feel
good when it does come, so we’re going to feed
you now.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m hungry all right,” sighed the
ragged boy.
</p>
<p>
“So’m I,” said his sister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
And so, hardly knowing what was going to
happen, the ragged boy, who said his name was
Dick, and his sister, who was Mary Thompson,
went with the little Bobbsey twins.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bobbsey was very much surprised when
her little son and daughter came up the steps,
leading a strange ragged boy and girl.
</p>
<p>
“We brought them home for Thanksgiving,
like Miss Pompret’s going to do,” said Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“So’s to make us be more happier,” added
Flossie. “And we gave them our two cents,
so please can we have more? And they’re hungry,
Mother!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bobbsey understood that it was the
kind hearts of Flossie and Freddie that had
brought all this about. So she welcomed the
two strange children, and took them out to
Dinah, who, you may be sure, fed them
enough, and almost too much.
</p>
<p>
After that meal, which Dick said was the
“best feed” he ever had eaten, and after Flossie
and Freddie had finished watching their
strange, ragged guests eat, Mrs. Bobbsey asked
Dick and his sister some questions.
</p>
<p>
She found out that they lived on the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
side of town, that their father was dead, and
that their mother did what she could for her
children.
</p>
<p>
“Do you go to our school?” asked Freddie,
during a pause in his mother’s questions.
“We’ve a nice school, and our teacher’s name
is Miss Snell, and——”
</p>
<p>
“And Freddie locked a boy up in the tool shed
’cause he pulled my hair—I mean the bad boy
pulled my hair,” broke in Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t go to school—our clothes is too
ragged,” said Mary, in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, my dear. Perhaps I can find
some clothes for you that aren’t quite so full
of holes,” offered Mrs. Bobbsey kindly.
“Clothes with holes in are fine for summer,”
she said, with a laugh, “but not so good for
winter. I’ll see what I can find.”
</p>
<p>
She found some good, half-worn garments
belonging to the twins, and Dick and Mary
took the clothes home. The result was that
they appeared at school the following Monday.
But neither Flossie nor Freddie spoke of their
mother having given the two fatherless children
clothes to wear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now we’ll be happy for Thanksgiving;
won’t we, Freddie?” asked Flossie, when it
was settled that Dick and Mary were to be
taken care of.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Freddie agreed. “And I hope we
have a big turkey!”
</p>
<p>
“An’ cranberry sauce!” added his sister.
</p>
<p>
There was a fine Thanksgiving dinner at
the Bobbsey home, but the mother of the four
twins did not forget the poor. She helped Miss
Pompret with that lady’s Thanksgiving feast
for those who were not fortunate enough to
have one of their own, and Mr. Bobbsey and
some other good-hearted men of Lakeport provided
money so that the Salvation Army could
feed a number of hungry men who were out
of work.
</p>
<p>
Still there was one reason why at least
Flossie and Freddie, of the Bobbsey family,
were not quite happy that Thanksgiving day.
And the reason was because there was no snow.
The children had polished their sleds, had
wiped the rust off the runners, and were all
ready for a coast. But without snow there
can be no sleigh riding, and though the weather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
was cold, the sun shone from a cloudless sky,
and Flossie and Freddie were much disappointed.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think it will ever snow, Mother?”
asked Flossie for about the twentieth time.
</p>
<p>
“And will there be ice so I can skate?”
Freddie wanted to know.
</p>
<p>
“Well, my dears, there will be snow and ice,
surely, in a little while,” answered Mrs. Bobbsey.
“But when I can not say. You must be
patient. Think of your blessings, as Uncle
William would say.”
</p>
<p>
“I want to have some fun,” complained
Freddie. “Oh, look!” he suddenly cried, coming
back to the window away from which he
had started to go.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“It’s our cat—Snoop! A big dog just came
along and Snoop ran up the tree. Now he can’t
get down!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, of course Snoop can get down out of
a tree,” said Nan. “He’s often climbed up
and down before.”
</p>
<p>
But this time Snoop did not come down.
Whether he had been too much frightened by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
the dog, or whether he was afraid of falling if
he started to come down backward out of the
tree, I don’t know. But Snoop stayed up on a
limb, where he cried pitifully.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get him down,” offered Bert. “I can
climb out on that limb from our front porch
roof. I’ve done it before.”
</p>
<p>
Bert went upstairs, climbed out on the porch
roof, and a little later was over in the tree
where Snoop was perched.
</p>
<p>
“Mew! Mew!” dismally cried the cat.
</p>
<p>
“I’m coming to get you,” said Bert, kindly.
“Wait a minute, Snoop!”
</p>
<p>
From the ground Flossie, Freddie and Nan
watched Bert make his way out on a limb toward
Snoop. And then, all of a sudden, there
was a cracking, breaking sound and Bert cried:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m falling! I’m going to fall!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—CHRISTMAS TREES</h2>
<p>
Several things happened all in a moment.
The cracking limb, Bert’s cries, and the swaying
of the bough as it bent toward the ground
with the weight of the Bobbsey boy frightened
Snoop, the cat. All this did just what was
needed, for it so frightened Snoop that down
he scrambled out of the tree, not caring whether
or not he fell.
</p>
<p>
Bert, as soon as he felt the tree branch giving
way with him, reached out his arms and
grasped whatever came first to his hands. This
happened to be another branch over his head,
so that there he was, his feet on one limb that
was slowly bending beneath his weight, and
his hands grasping a branch above him.
</p>
<p>
And, to add to the excitement, Flossie and
Freddie, who saw what danger Bert was in,
set up a dismal crying.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Bert’s going to fall! Bert’s going to
fall!” yelled Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Daddy! Mother! Dinah! Somebody!
Come quick!” exclaimed Flossie. “Catch Bert
before he falls!”
</p>
<p>
Nan ran out under the tree and stood with
her dress held up, as she used to do when her
father picked apples and dropped them down to
her. Nan may have thought Bert could drop
down and she would catch him, as a man jumps
into a circus net from the top of the tent. But,
again, perhaps Nan was so excited that she
really did not know what she was doing.
</p>
<p>
However, daddy and mother came hurrying
to the window, attracted by the cries of the
children, and Mr. Bobbsey, seeing just what
was needed, said to his wife:
</p>
<p>
“Run and tell Sam to come here with the
ladder. It stands back of the chicken house.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” said Mrs. Bobbsey. So, instead of
running out after Mr. Bobbsey to see poor
Bert dangling in the tree, she hurried to the
rear door and called to Sam, who was working
over Mr. Bobbsey’s automobile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sam! Sam! Bring the ladder out in front,
quick!” cried Mrs. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“Ladder! De ladder?” repeated the colored
husband of fat Dinah. “Am dey a fire some
place?”
</p>
<p>
“No fire!” answered Mrs. Bobbsey. “But
Bert is up a tree and he is falling! Mr. Bobbsey
wants the ladder to get him down!
Hurry!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” answered Sam. Then he hurried to
the chicken house, got the ladder, and hurried
around to the front of the house with it.
</p>
<p>
“Can you hold on a little longer, Bert?”
asked his father anxiously, as Sam began to
raise the ladder up into the tree.
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess so,” was the answer. “Is Snoop
all right?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Snoop’s all right. He jumped. But
don’t you jump!” called Nan.
</p>
<p>
“I—I won’t,” Bert answered.
</p>
<p>
Then his father and Sam raised the ladder
up into the tree, and a few minutes later they
had rescued Bert, helping him so that he
could put his feet on the ladder and climb
down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
“What made you go up?” asked his mother,
when the excitement was all over.
</p>
<p>
“I went up after Snoop,” said Bert. “A
strange dog chased him up the tree.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, of course, you meant to be kind,”
said his father. “But you must be careful
when in a tree. Very often a branch may look
sound and strong, as though it would hold you
up. But when you step on it or pull on it, it
breaks. It is always a good plan, if you climb
a tree in the woods—or anywhere else—to pull
on a limb to test it before you bear your full
weight on it. If you hear a cracking sound it
means that the branch will break.”
</p>
<p>
“I heard a cracking sound,” Bert said. “But
that was after I got out on the limb with my
feet.”
</p>
<p>
“Then it was almost too late,” his father
said. “But remember always to test a branch
before you trust yourself to it.”
</p>
<p>
The Bobbsey twins and the others went back
into the house, and the rest of the Thanksgiving
day passed pleasantly. Snoop and Snap
had been given especially good dinners in honor
of the occasion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
In the morning, when Flossie and Freddie
awakened, which generally happened at the
same time, the little fellow ran to the window
and looked out.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look, Flossie! Look!” he cried.
“Come and see!”
</p>
<p>
“Is Snoop up the tree again?” asked the
little girl.
</p>
<p>
“No, but it’s snowing! Snowing hard!
Now we can have some fun with our sleds!
Come on, we’ll go coasting!”
</p>
<p>
Later the two smaller Bobbsey twins, having
had their breakfasts, ran out to play in the
snow. Quite a little had fallen during the
night, and more was coming down. It was
just about right for starting to make a coasting
hill.
</p>
<p>
Not far from the Bobbsey home, on a side
street, was a hill where the smaller children
had their fun. Bert and Nan, with some of
the older boys and girls, generally went to a
longer and steeper hill some distance away.
But this time Bert and Nan had not gotten out
their sleds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to wait for Charlie Mason,” said
Bert. “He said he’d come over as soon as it
snowed. We’re going to make a bob.”
</p>
<p>
“May I have a ride on it?” asked Nan. “I’ll
help you get some pieces of carpet to tack on
if you’ll let me ride.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure we’ll let you,” agreed Bert. And then
he went to telephone over to ask if Charlie
were coming.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Flossie and Freddie and some of
their friends were having fun on the small
hill. Each of the smaller Bobbsey twins had
a sled, and the children had races to see who
would get first to the bottom of the slope.
With merry shouts and laughter they played
amid the swirling flakes of white snow.
</p>
<p>
The fun was at its liveliest, and Flossie and
Freddie were among the merriest, when along
came Nick Malone, the boy whom Freddie had
locked in the tool shed at school.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Freddie! Look!” whispered Flossie,
dropping the rope of her sled and moving
closer to her brother.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked Freddie, for he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
watching Sammie Henderson go down hill
backward on a “dare.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s that—that bad boy!” whispered Flossie.
“He might pull my hair!”
</p>
<p>
“If he does, I’ll—I’ll——” began Freddie,
and then up swaggered Nick.
</p>
<p>
“Hu! you can’t do nothin’ to me now,” he
sneered. “There ain’t no teacher or principal
here! There!” and he reached over as if to
pull Flossie’s hair.
</p>
<p>
“You let my sister alone!” cried Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Yah! Yah! Why don’t you wear girls’
dresses!” taunted Nick. “You’re a girl-boy!
Girl-boy!”
</p>
<p>
“I am not!” declared Freddie, while the
other coasters gathered around. “You go on
away!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to have a coast! Here, I guess
I’ll take this sled!” cried Nick, and before
Freddie could stop him the bad boy caught
Flossie’s sled from the ground and ran with
it toward the top of the hill.
</p>
<p>
“Here! You come back! You let my sister’s
sled alone!” shouted Freddie, racing after
Nick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
Now Freddie was a good runner, but Nick
had the start of him, and reached the top of
the hill first. However, Freddie was not far
behind, and no sooner did Nick throw himself
flat on the little Bobbsey girl’s sled, face down,
than Freddie made a jump, and right on top
of Nick’s back he landed!
</p>
<p>
“Hi! Get off!” cried Nick, his breath
rather knocked out of him, for Freddie was a
fat, chubby little fellow.
</p>
<p>
“You get off my sister’s sled!” demanded
Flossie’s brother.
</p>
<p>
But it was too late for this. It was impossible
for Nick to stop now, and down the hill
he coasted on Flossie’s sled, with Freddie on
his back, both boys coasting together!
</p>
<p>
It was a trick the children often did on the
hill, and there was nothing hard about it.
Only this time it happened to be an accident,
and the two boys were enemies and not
friends.
</p>
<p>
Freddie was so surprised at the sudden and
unexpected coast that he just had to hold fast
to Nick and he could say nothing more. But
when the bottom of the hill was reached, Freddie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
being on top, began to pound Nick’s back
with his two sturdy fists.
</p>
<p>
“Hey! Quit! Let me up!” begged the bad
boy.
</p>
<p>
“Not till you give me my sister’s sled!” insisted
Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Well, how can I give it to her when you’re
sittin’ on me?” yelled Nick.
</p>
<p>
With that Freddie got off the other lad’s
back, allowing him to get up. The other boys
gathered around, thinking there might be a
fight. But Nick had had enough. He found
Freddie braver than he had thought, and turned
away, muttering:
</p>
<p>
“Aw, I only wanted a ride an’ I got it!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and Freddie had one too!” laughed
Sam Miller.
</p>
<p>
Nick walked away, and then the younger
Bobbsey twins again started coasting, Freddie
taking Flossie’s sled back to her.
</p>
<p>
It was still snowing when noon came, and
Flossie and Freddie had to go home to lunch.
They found Bert and Charlie busy making a
bobsled in the back yard. The older boys were
fastening together their sleds by a long plank,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
and Nan was helping by tacking some strips
of carpet on the plank.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, can we ride on that?” asked Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe,” said his brother. “How’s the little
hill?”
</p>
<p>
“Nice,” Freddie answered.
</p>
<p>
“An’ you ought to’ve seen Nick Malone take
my sled and Freddie jump on his back!” cried
Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Is that fellow bothering you two again?”
demanded Bert, looking up with a hammer in
his hand. “I’ll get after him, that’s what I
will!”
</p>
<p>
“Freddie got after him,” explained Flossie.
“Oh, I’m so glad it snows! We’re going coasting
some more after dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” added Freddie.
</p>
<p>
At the dinner table Bert and Nan noticed
that their father seemed worried over something.
He went to the window several times
to look out at the storm.
</p>
<p>
“If this keeps up the shipment will never
arrive,” he said to his wife.
</p>
<p>
“You mean the Christmas trees?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Mr. Bobbsey. “They are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
late now, and something seems to be wrong up
there in the woods.”
</p>
<p>
“Shan’t we have any Christmas tree?” asked
Freddie, who did not know just what was being
talked about.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I guess so,” his father said, and again
he went to look at the snow.
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to sell Christmas trees?”
Bert asked. He had caught the word “shipment,”
and knew it had to do with some part
of his father’s lumber business.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am going into the Christmas tree
business this year,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “That
is, I have bought a large shipment of them to
be sent here to me from the North Woods. If
they get here in time I can sell them and make
some money. But if this snow keeps up, the
carloads of trees, or the shipment, will be delayed,
and if they don’t get here at least a
week before Christmas they will be of little
use to me. But perhaps the snow will not be
as heavy as I fear.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know you sold Christmas trees,”
remarked Nan.

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>
“I never did before,” her father said. “It’s
a new business for me, and I may make a
failure of it.”
</p>
<p>
Then the older Bobbsey twins began to understand
how it is that snow can bring pleasure
to boys and girls, but may often mean trouble
for older people in business.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll hope for the best,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, as he started back to the office after
dinner, when the white flakes were still falling
steadily. “I may have to go up to the North
Woods to see about that shipment of trees if
they don’t get here soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Could we go?” asked Bert, having a joyful
vision of a mid-winter trip to one of his father’s
lumber camps.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll see,” answered Mr. Bobbsey, and
Nan and Bert looked at each other in delight.
</p>
<p>
Some strange adventures were ahead of
them, though they did not know it.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—OFF TO CEDAR CAMP</h2>
<p>
Bert and Charlie, with Nan’s help, finished
the bobsled in time to use on the coasting hill
that afternoon and early in the evening. And
it is a good thing they had hurried with it, for
the next day there came a thaw and the snow
began to melt. It melted so fast that by noon
there was scarcely enough for Flossie and
Freddie to have any fun on even the small hill,
and what snow there was had mostly turned
to slush.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear,” sighed Nan, when she found
that she and her brothers and sister had to
give up their pleasure, “this isn’t any fun!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” agreed Bert. “But the winter
isn’t over. We always have a lot of snow
after Christmas.”
</p>
<p>
“And I suppose we ought to be glad there
isn’t a big storm,” went on Nan, when it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
been decided to give up coasting and the older
Bobbsey twins were dragging home the new
bobsled.
</p>
<p>
“Why ought we be glad?” Bert wanted to
know.
</p>
<p>
“Because if it doesn’t storm so much daddy
can get his shipment of Christmas trees here
and make some money.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s so—I forgot!” exclaimed Bert.
“But if the trees do come we can’t make that
trip with him to the North Woods to see what
the matter is. And I wanted to go on a trip
like that, for we don’t have much school now,
on account of the holidays.”
</p>
<p>
“It would be nice to go off somewhere in the
winter,” agreed Nan. “Remember what fun
we had at Snow Lodge?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say so!” cried Bert. “But there
isn’t much use talking about snow when it
thaws like this,” and he stepped into a puddle
of slush.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, be careful!” cried Nan. “You’ll get
your feet wet!”
</p>
<p>
“I have rubbers on,” said Bert.
</p>
<p>
There was nothing to do but to leave the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
bobsled and the other sleds in the shed attached
to the garage. There they would stay
until more snow came. When Bert went into
the house, after putting away the bobsled and
helping Flossie and Freddie store away their
smaller sleds, he found his mother waiting for
him.
</p>
<p>
“Bert,” said Mrs. Bobbsey, “here is a special
delivery letter that just came for your
father. It should have been delivered at the
office, but they sent it here by mistake, and
Dinah took it in before I could call to the boy
to take it back with him. I called your father
up about it on the telephone and he said, if
you came in, to have you bring it down.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go,” replied Bert cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, may we go along?” begged Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be good!” promised Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Shall I take them?” asked Bert of his
mother.
</p>
<p>
“If you want to,” she answered. “Does
Nan want to go?”
</p>
<p>
But Nan, as it happened, had some sewing
she wanted to do on a Christmas gift for one
of her girl friends, so she said she would stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
in the house and busy herself with needle and
thread. Thus it came about that Bert took the
smaller Bobbsey twins down to his father’s
office.
</p>
<p>
They went in a trolley car, and, as they
always did, Freddie and Flossie became very
much interested in everything that happened,
from the fat lady who could hardly get on to
the scenes in the streets.
</p>
<p>
There were many trucks and wagons in one
street, as the car came nearer that part of
Lakeport in which Mr. Bobbsey’s lumberyard
and office were situated. Finally the street became
so crowded with wagons and automobiles
that the car had to proceed slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Freddie, look!” suddenly called Flossie,
pointing out of the window. A big auto-truck,
piled high with crates, in which were chickens
and ducks, had come to a stop alongside of
the trolley car, and so close that, had the window
been open, the Bobbsey twins could have
reached out their hands and touched some of
the fowls.
</p>
<p>
“I guess they’re getting in big shipments of
ducks, turkeys and chickens ready for Christmas,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
said Bert. “Look out there, Freddie!”
he suddenly called, and, leaping from his place
beside Flossie, Bert made a grab and pulled
Freddie off the seat.
</p>
<p>
Only just in time, too, for at that moment
the auto-truck, which had started off after being
stalled, lurched to one side, and a corner
of one of the chicken crates crashed through
a car window, breaking the glass.
</p>
<p>
Bert had seen the crate of chickens shifting
around as the truck started, and had guessed
that it was going to slide over and crash against
the trolley car, just as it did. So he pulled
Freddie away in time.
</p>
<p>
Some of the passengers in the car screamed,
and there was a shout by the conductor and
motorman as the glass crashed in the electric
vehicle.
</p>
<p>
And then a funny thing happened. One of
the slats of the chicken crate on the auto-truck
came loose, and in through the broken window
fluttered a hen and a rooster. Right into the
trolley they flew, the hen cackling and the
rooster crowing!
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look! Look!” cried Flossie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“Catch ’em!” shouted Freddie, pulling away
from Bert and grabbing for the rooster.
</p>
<p>
But the rooster did not intend to be caught.
Half running and half flying, he “scooted,” as
Freddie called it, down to the end of the car,
and, as the conductor had just opened the door
to look out and see what was causing the
blockade, the rooster made his escape.
</p>
<p>
The hen, however, did not seem to know how
to get out. She fluttered around, cackling and
making a great fuss. The men in the car
laughed, and the women held their hands over
their hats so the chicken would not light on
them.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she came in here to lay an egg!”
suggested Flossie, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“I’m goin’ to catch her!” shouted Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Get her and have a chicken dinner,” said
the motorman.
</p>
<p>
By this time the car was in an uproar, most
of the passengers enjoying the queer excitement.
As for the hen, I do not think she liked
it at all, though she had more room than in
the crate.
</p>
<p>
The driver of the auto-truck was talking to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
a policeman about whose fault it was that the
trolley window had become broken, and the
motorman and conductor now joined in.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got to get that chicken and rooster
back,” said the truck driver. “I’ll be blamed
for letting them get away.”
</p>
<p>
“And we’ll be blamed for having a window
in our car broken,” said the conductor. “It
was your fault.”
</p>
<p>
“It was not!” insisted the driver.
</p>
<p>
Cackling and fluttering, the hen raced about
inside the trolley car, and Freddie tried to
catch her, but could not. Several of the
men made grabs for the lively fowl, but finally
she saw the same open door by which the
rooster had gotten out, and away she flew.
</p>
<p>
“She didn’t like it in here,” observed Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t blame her,” said a woman passenger,
laughing. “Poor thing! Her nerves
must be all on an edge.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go and see if they catch ’em,” suggested
Freddie. But Bert said they had no
time for that.
</p>
<p>
The slipping crate, which had broken the
window, was finally pulled back on the truck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
The slat was nailed fast so no other fowls
could get out, and then the trolley car moved
along. The conductor picked up the larger
pieces of broken glass and pulled the curtain
down over the window to keep out the cold
air.
</p>
<p>
“My, you must have had some excitement,”
said Mr. Bobbsey, when the children finally
reached his office and told him of the accident.
“I’m glad Freddie wasn’t cut by the broken
glass.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad, too,” said the little Bobbsey boy.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bobbsey read the letter Bert had brought
him, and then the same worried look Bert had
seen before came over his father’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Do you want me to tell mother anything?”
asked Bert.
</p>
<p>
“No, except to thank her for sending me
down this letter. Still, you might say to her
that I think I shall have to go to Cedar Camp
in a day or two.”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Cedar Camp?” asked Bert.
</p>
<p>
“Where the Christmas trees grow,” his
father answered, with a smile. “It’s where
the Christmas trees grow that I hope to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
to sell. I haven’t got them yet, and I’m going
there to see what the trouble is. This letter
is about the trees.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, can’t we go and see where the Christmas
trees grow?” begged Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“We like it in the woods,” said Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you do,” his father answered,
smiling. “But the woods in winter are very
different from in summer. However, we shall
not have any bad storms or severe weather for
another month, I think. Perhaps I might be
able to take my Bobbsey twins to Cedar Camp,”
and he playfully pinched Flossie’s fat cheek.
</p>
<p>
“It would be nifty to go!” said Bert. “Do
you really think you’ll take us?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll talk it over to-night at home,” said
his father. “Here, take Flossie and Freddie
to the store and get them some hot chocolate,”
he added, giving Bert some money.
</p>
<p>
The little Bobbsey twins liked the chocolate
very much, but they were so excited, thinking
about a possible trip to the North Woods, that
they talked of nothing else.
</p>
<p>
“Do you really think you will have to go?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
asked Mrs. Bobbsey of her husband that evening.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he answered. “Those Christmas trees
have been lost somewhere between Cedar Camp
and here, and I must find them, or I shall lose
a lot on them. I will go to Cedar Camp in
a few days.”
</p>
<p>
“And take us?” asked Bert.
</p>
<p>
“All of us!” cried Freddie.
</p>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey looked at one another.
</p>
<p>
“Would you like to go?” asked Mr. Bobbsey
of his wife.
</p>
<p>
“Where could we stay?” she inquired.
</p>
<p>
“There is a large log cabin that one of my
foremen used to live in,” Mr. Bobbsey answered.
“The cabin is empty, and we could
stay there as long as the weather did not get
too cold, and as long as there were no bad
storms. I really ought to go right to the woods,
so that if I cannot get on the track of the lost
shipment of Christmas trees I can start the
men to cutting others. So we might as well
all go.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what fun!” cried the Bobbsey twins.
</p>
<p>
Since that first fall of snow, which did not
last very long, there had been no storms in
the region of Lakeport, and Mr. Bobbsey
thought he could get to Cedar Camp and return
with his family before the really severe
winter weather set in. He did not believe it
would take long to look up the matter of the
delayed shipment of the Christmas trees and
straighten it out.
</p>
<p>
So it was settled, and a few days later, when
plans had been completed, the Bobbsey family
started for Cedar Camp.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—IN THE NORTH WOODS</h2>
<p>
“It’s just lovely to take a trip like this,” said
Nan, as she leaned back in the automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Swell, I call it,” declared Bert.
</p>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie said nothing just then.
They were too busy looking from the windows.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bobbsey owned a large, closed automobile,
which even had an arrangement for heating,
and it was just the proper vehicle for a
trip like this. It easily held all the Bobbseys
and their baggage, which had been piled in to
go with them.
</p>
<p>
It had not taken long to make preparations
for the trip. Dinah and Sam would be left
in charge of the Lakeport house, and would
care for Snoop and Snap.
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could take our cat along,” sighed
Flossie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“And Snap would be just right for the
woods,” said Freddie. “Everybody has a dog
in the woods.”
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t time to bother with Snoop and
Snap now,” said Mrs. Bobbsey, so the dog and
cat had been left at home, as much to their
sorrow as to that of the Bobbsey twins.
</p>
<p>
Cedar Camp was in what was called the
“North Woods,” about forty or fifty miles
from Lakeport. It was a wild, desolate region,
especially in the winter. In summer many
camping parties made the place more lively.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bobbsey owned some timberland there,
from which was cut some of the lumber he
used in his business. And it was only this year
that he had decided to go into the Christmas
tree trade. He had ordered many hundreds
of the small cedars, spruce, and hemlocks cut
and shipped to him, some to Lakeport and
others to a more distant and larger city.
</p>
<p>
But something had gone wrong with the carloads
of trees. They had started from Cedar
Camp all right, but that was the last heard of
them.
</p>
<p>
“I can trace them from the North Woods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
end better than from down here,” Mr. Bobbsey
had said, as a reason for making the trip.
</p>
<p>
The men who went into the woods to cut
timber and Christmas trees had to stay in
winter camps. They lived in log or slab cabins,
and there were many of them scattered
through the North Woods. It was in one of
these cabins, which had formerly been used by
a foreman and his family, that Mr. Bobbsey
planned to have his wife and children stay for
about a week. It would take him that long,
he thought, to locate the missing Christmas
trees.
</p>
<p>
And so now the Bobbsey twins were on the
first part of their journey in the large, closed
automobile. It was almost as comfortable as
traveling in a Pullman railroad car, and it was
much more fun, the children thought.
</p>
<p>
They had brought with them plenty of lunch,
some extra wraps, and some blankets and bed-clothes.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we eat when we get to the
North Woods?” asked Freddie, as he munched
some cookies his mother passed to him and
Flossie. “Shall we have any—chicken?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
“If we could ’a’ brought the one in the trolley
car we could,” suggested Flossie. “Wasn’t
she funny, an’ the rooster, too?”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could ’a’ caught them,” Freddie
murmured.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I think we’ll have enough to eat without
those fowls,” said their mother.
</p>
<p>
“They will if they like baked beans,” said
Mr. Bobbsey. “The lumbermen have plenty
of those. They bake big pans of them.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll help mother cook,” offered Nan.
</p>
<p>
“There will be a woman at the camp to
cook,” Mr. Bobbsey explained. “I wrote up
and engaged the wife of one of the lumbermen,”
he said. “I thought you’d like a little
rest from looking after housework even in
camp,” he said to his wife.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, I will,” she said. “It will be
quite nice to be in the woods in winter; especially
the Christmas tree woods, where there
is so much greenery.”
</p>
<p>
On went the automobile, driven by Mr. Bobbsey.
Lakeport was left behind and they were
on a country road. The weather was fine, with
hardly a cloud in the sky, and Mr. Bobbsey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
was glad that he had taken his family on this
little trip.
</p>
<p>
It looked as though they were going to have
good luck all the way. Noon came and saw
them more than half over their journey, and
as yet no mishaps had befallen them. There
was no tire trouble and the engine of the big
automobile seemed glad to work as hard as it
could going up hill and on the level with the
Bobbsey twins.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bobbsey planned to get to Cedar Camp
before dark, and he would have done so but
for a little accident. They had left the town
of Bunkport, which was the last village before
the North Woods was reached, when the motor
began to chug in a queer manner.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey. “One
of the cylinders seems to be missing.”
</p>
<p>
The Bobbsey twins knew what this meant.
That one of the parts of the automobile engine
was not working properly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Daddy!” exclaimed Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“I guess the spark plug needs cleaning,” said
Mr. Bobbsey. “But we won’t stop for that
now. I think we can reach Cedar Camp, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
then I’ll have plenty of time to take it out and
look at it.”
</p>
<p>
But the automobile continued to go more
and more slowly, and once, on a hill, it almost
stopped.
</p>
<p>
“If we can get over the top we can coast
down and soon be in Cedar Camp,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, in answer to an anxious look from
his wife.
</p>
<p>
The car did manage to climb the hill, and
then it was easy to go down the other side.
But there was still a farther distance to go
than Mr. Bobbsey had thought. The night
settled down, it became dark, and then, suddenly,
when the car was on a rough road in a
sort of lane cut through the evergreen trees,
the engine, with a sort of cough and chug,
stopped altogether.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“We’re stalled!”
</p>
<p>
“Looks like it,” said Mr. Bobbsey, preparing
to get out and see what the trouble was.
</p>
<p>
“Where are we?” asked Bert, getting ready
to follow his father and help if he could.
</p>
<p>
“We’re in the North Woods,” answered Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
Bobbsey. “Several miles from Cedar Camp,
I’m afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“It—it’s awful dark!” whispered Flossie.
“Aren’t they going to turn on the lights?”
</p>
<p>
“There aren’t ever any lights in the woods
’ceptin’ fireflies, are there, Daddy?” asked
Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Only our auto lights,” answered his father.
“Well, we may be able to travel soon.”
</p>
<p>
As he was getting out of the car into the
dark road, a mournful, shrill cry that echoed
all about sounded through the forest.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” gasped Nan, shrinking close
to her mother. “Oh, what is it?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—A NUTTING PARTY</h2>
<p>
Mrs. Bobbsey was rather alarmed at what
had happened to the automobile to cause it to
stop. She was also worried, thinking perhaps
they all might have to stay out in the woods
all night, if they could not go on to camp.
So when Nan asked the cause of the strange
noise her mother did not at first answer.
</p>
<p>
The sound came again, just as Bert was
getting down out of the car to go to his father,
who had lifted the hood over the motor to see
what was wrong, and the strange sound so
startled this Bobbsey twin lad that he let go
his hold of the side of the car and slid with
a bump to the ground.
</p>
<p>
“Ugh!” grunted Bert, as he fell.
</p>
<p>
He grunted in such a funny way, and he
looked so odd sitting there in the dusk, as if
he did not know what had happened, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
Flossie and Freddie laughed. And this
laughter seemed to make them less afraid of
the queer call of the woods.
</p>
<p>
“Hurt yourself, Bert?” asked his father,
looking up from his task of throwing the
gleams of a flashlight in among the parts of
the automobile motor.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” Bert answered. “I just sat down
sudden, that’s all. But what was that noise,
Daddy? Is it——”
</p>
<p>
As if finding fault because the Bobbsey twins
had come to Cedar Camp, once more the warning
call came.
</p>
<p>
“There it goes again!” exclaimed Nan.
</p>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie shrank closer to their
mother, and even Nan seemed a little afraid,
but Mr. Bobbsey only laughed.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a hoot owl—or a screech owl, I
don’t know which,” he said. “Anyhow, it’s
only a bird with feathers and big, staring eyes.
And, very likely, it’s looking down at us now
and wondering what we’re doing in his woods.”
</p>
<p>
“Is the owl looking at us now?” asked
Freddie, climbing away from his mother and
venturing to the door of the car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
“Very likely,” his father said. “But the
chances are you can’t see it. Owls keep pretty
well hidden when there’s any daylight left.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, the light is fast fading,” said Mrs.
Bobbsey. “It’s getting dark very fast, Dick.
And unless we get to camp soon—well, you
know what may happen,” she said to her husband.
“Do you think you can get the motor
to going?”
</p>
<p>
“I think so,” he answered. “Bert, please
come here and hold the light for me.”
</p>
<p>
Glad to be of help to his father, Bert arose
from the ground, to which he had slipped when
the sudden noise of the owl startled him, and
went to hold the flash lamp. As he sent the
beam moving about, in order to direct it just
where his father wished it, there was a whirr
and a flutter in the almost leafless branches
of the trees overhead, and Flossie cried:
</p>
<p>
“There it is!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that’s Mr. Owl,” laughed her father.
“He came up to look at us, but he doesn’t like
our bright light, because it hurts his eyes. So
he flew away. Now come on, Bert, and we’ll
get the motor to running again. They’ll be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
anxious at Cedar Camp if we don’t get there
soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Do they expect us?” asked Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, surely,” said her father. “Hold the
light steady, Bert.”
</p>
<p>
The Bobbsey twin lad did as requested, and
after a little examination, his father exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“I see what the trouble is—a loose wire on
a spark plug! That’s easily fixed. We’ll be
traveling on again in a few minutes.”
</p>
<p>
And so they were. Once the wire was fastened
in place, the automobile could go again.
Bert and his father got back in, there was
a chugging and throb of the motor, and off
they went through the woods, the two headlights
gleaming along the dark road in the
midst of the trees.
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could have arrived by daylight,”
said Mr. Bobbsey, as he carefully steered the
car. “Cedar Camp looks ever so much better
then.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to get here at all—so we don’t
have to stay out in the woods all night,” said
Mrs. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“It would be fun to be out in the woods all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
night—if owls didn’t bite you—wouldn’t it,
Flossie?” asked Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I guess maybe,” answered the little
girl. “But I’d rather be in our camp an’ have
something to eat.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I would, too,” agreed Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here we are, then. Cedar Camp!”
suddenly cried Mr. Bobbsey, and, almost before
the twins knew it, the car had turned from the
dense woods and was in a clearing, or place
where many trees were chopped down.
</p>
<p>
Around the clearing were many log cabins,
and inside some of them, and outside others,
lanterns were glowing, so the place was quite
light, compared to the darkness of the forest.
</p>
<p>
“Cedar Camp!” cried Bert. “Is this it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” his father answered. “Here we are—a
little late, but better late than never! Now
to find our cabin.”
</p>
<p>
He guided the car into the midst of the
clearing, and the children could see the various
cabin doors opening and men and women looking
out.
</p>
<p>
“That you, Mr. Bobbsey?” a voice called.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Jim Denton,” was the answer. “We’re
here!”
</p>
<p>
“Thought maybe you’d given up and
wouldn’t get here until to-morrow,” the voice
went on.
</p>
<p>
As the car stopped the Bobbsey twins saw a
tall, lanky man, wearing rough clothes, but
whose face had a kind smile and whose blue
eyes looked laughingly at them. He stood at
the side of the car, peering in.
</p>
<p>
“We did have a little trouble,” said Mr.
Bobbsey. “And one of your owls seemed to
think we hadn’t any right in the woods. But
here we are!”
</p>
<p>
“One of the owls, eh?” laughed Jim Denton,
the foreman of the Christmas tree and
lumber camp. “Well, they sure are queer
birds! Make an outlandish racket, sometimes.
But come on in. Your place is all ready for
you, and Mrs. Baxter has had supper ready
for some time.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s good!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“The children are half starved, I fancy.”
</p>
<p>
“Run your car over to the shed,” said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
foreman to Mr. Bobbsey. “It’ll be safe there
if it snows.”
</p>
<p>
“Had any snow up here yet?” asked the
father of the twins.
</p>
<p>
“Not yet, but it may come any day. I heard
you had a little down your way.”
</p>
<p>
“But it didn’t last very long,” Freddie chimed
in. “We didn’t have much coasting at all!”
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t, eh?” laughed Jim, as he lifted
out Flossie and Freddie, Bert and Nan being
too big for this attention. “Well, when we
do get snow up here we generally get a lot, and
it may come any time. But the longer it holds
off the better we can get out lumber and Christmas
trees.”
</p>
<p>
“What about my Christmas trees?” asked
Mr. Bobbsey. “That’s what I came up about.”
</p>
<p>
“It is queer about those trees,” said the foreman,
as he helped Mrs. Bobbsey out. “We
sent a lot off from here, but they must be stuck
somewhere on the railroad down below. However,
if they’re lost we can cut more. There’s
plenty in the woods.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bobbsey and the children waited until
Mr. Bobbsey had put the car under a shed, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
then, when he joined them, the family, led by
the foreman, walked toward the largest cabin
in the clearing. This was to be the home of
the Bobbseys while they were at Cedar Camp.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I am glad to see you folks!” exclaimed
Mrs. Baxter, who was to do the cooking
and help Mrs. Bobbsey during the stay in
camp. “I began to be afraid that something
had happened.”
</p>
<p>
“A wire came loose,” said Freddie. “But
daddy soon fixed it. And we heard an owl
hoot. Do you like owls?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, not specially,” answered Mrs. Baxter,
with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t, either,” said Flossie.
</p>
<p>
The Bobbsey twins looked about the cabin
that was to be their home for a time. It was
a large one, and had been used by a former
foreman with a large family. There were
several bedrooms and it had many of the comforts
of life, even though it stood in the North
Woods.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Baxter was the wife of one of the men
employed in cutting down trees, and she had
agreed to cook for the Bobbseys during their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
stay. She and her husband lived in one of
the smaller cabins, and her grown daughter
would cook for Mr. Baxter while his wife was
with the Bobbseys.
</p>
<p>
“Now get your things off and sit right up
to the table,” cried Mrs. Baxter. “The supper’s
sort of spoiled, keeping so long.”
</p>
<p>
“I fancy the twins are hungry enough to
eat almost anything,” said their mother. “I
know I am!”
</p>
<p>
In spite of what Mrs. Baxter said, the supper
proved to be very good indeed, and Flossie
and Freddie passed their plates back so often
to be filled again that their father said:
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! there won’t be anything left
for breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t there, Mother?” asked Freddie anxiously,
pausing with his fork half way to his
mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes! Of course! Your father’s only
joking!” she said, with a laugh. “But don’t
eat too much.”
</p>
<p>
“I want just a little more,” begged Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Can we go out and look at the camp after
supper?” Bert wanted to know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
“You can’t see much by lantern light,” his
father told him. “You’ll have plenty of
chances to-morrow and the next few days.”
</p>
<p>
Bert found it too dark out of doors when he
took a look after leaving the table, and decided
to wait until morning.
</p>
<p>
The cabin was warm and cosy, and the Bobbsey
twins thought they had never come to a
more delightful place than Cedar Camp. They
sat and talked a little while after the meal,
and then, when Flossie and Freddie began to
show signs of being sleepy, their mother said
it was time for them to go to bed. Bert and
Nan soon followed.
</p>
<p>
It seemed to be the middle of the night when
Flossie, awakened from a sound sleep, heard
a great noise and loud shouting outside the log
cabin.
</p>
<p>
“Mother! Mother! What’s that?” she
whispered.
</p>
<p>
“Only the lumbermen going to work,” Mrs.
Bobbsey answered.
</p>
<p>
“Do they go to work in the night?” Flossie
wanted to know.
</p>
<p>
“It’s almost morning—the sun will soon be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
up,” her mother told the little girl. “Keep
quiet and don’t awaken Freddie.”
</p>
<p>
Flossie turned over and closed her eyes,
thinking it strange that men should have to
get up and go to work in the night. It was
dark, and the stars were shining, as she could
see by a glimpse through her window.
</p>
<p>
“I guess maybe they’re like Santa Claus,”
thought Flossie. “They have to go out to
cut Christmas trees in the dark, same as St.
Nicholas comes to our house in the dark on
Christmas Eve.”
</p>
<p>
Content with this thought, the little girl
fell asleep, not to awaken again until it was
broad daylight. She found that all were up
save Freddie and herself, but the youngest
Bobbsey twins soon joined the others at the
breakfast table.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goodie!” cried Freddie, when he understood
that Mrs. Baxter was baking buckwheat
cakes and had maple syrup to pour over
them. “That’s what I like!”
</p>
<p>
“He can’t like ’em all, can he, Mother?”
cried Flossie. “I can have some pancakes, can’t
I?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hush! There’ll be plenty for all of you!”
said Mrs. Bobbsey. “What will Mrs. Baxter
think?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll think they’re good and hungry; and that
is what I like to see when I’m baking cakes,”
laughed the good-natured cook. She was almost
as nice as Dinah, Freddie whispered to
Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“An’ if she has a birthday we—we’ll give
her something,” whispered Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Freddie, holding out his plate
for another cake.
</p>
<p>
After breakfast Mrs. Bobbsey took the children
for a walk in the woods around the camp,
while Mr. Bobbsey went to talk with some of
his lumbermen about the missing Christmas
trees.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t go too far away,” he called to his
wife.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Because the woods here are rather wild,
and you and the children might get lost. There
aren’t many trails, paths, or roads. Keep
close to camp.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” she promised.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
It was wonderful and beautiful in the North
Woods, even though winter was at hand. Most
of the birds had gone, and about the only
trees that had any leaves on were the oaks.
An oak tree holds many of its leaves all winter,
the old ones being pushed off in the spring
as the new ones come on. But there were so
many spruce, pine, hemlock, and cedar trees
growing all about—trees which remain green
from one year to the other—that the woods
were not as bare and dreary as are most forests.
Cedar Camp was indeed a green Christmas
camp, and a most lovely place.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have lots of fun here!” cried Freddie,
running to the edge of a little hill.
</p>
<p>
“Lots of fun!” agreed Flossie. “We’ll——”
and then she stopped suddenly, for Freddie did
a queer thing—or at least a queer thing happened
to the little fellow. His feet seemed to
slide out from under him, and down the hill
he went, almost as though sliding on the ice!
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look! Look!” cried Flossie. “What
made him do that?”
</p>
<p>
“I slid! I slid! Oh, I had a slide! I’m
going to slide it again!” cried Freddie, jumping up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
and scrambling to the top of the hill
again. “Come on, Flossie!”
</p>
<p>
“What makes him slide, Mother?” asked
Flossie, as she saw her little brother go down
the hill standing up, just as he and his small
sister had often done on a snowy, icy slope.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the pine needles,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“The ground is covered with the long, brown,
smooth pine needles, and they make a slippery
carpet. You may slide on them. If you fall
you won’t be hurt.”
</p>
<p>
Soon the two smaller Bobbsey twins were
having great fun sliding down the slippery pine-needle-covered
hill, and Bert and Nan also took
their turns.
</p>
<p>
But after two or three slides Bert found
something on the ground that made him exclaim
in delight and run to his mother to show
her.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” he cried. “A chestnut! Are there
chestnuts in these woods?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I did hear your father say something
about them,” Mrs. Bobbsey replied.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let’s hunt for some!” cried Nan.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll help!” added Flossie and Freddie, deserting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
the pine-needle slide for the joys of
nutting.
</p>
<p>
But though the twins looked in all directions
they found only a few scattered chestnuts.
</p>
<p>
“The squirrels have picked up most of them,”
said Jim Denton, coming along a little later.
“But there’s a chestnut grove not far away,
up Pine Brook, and there ought to be plenty
left if you don’t wait too long.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mother! may Nan and I go chestnutting?”
asked Bert. “I want to get a lot!”
</p>
<p>
“Will it be safe for them?” asked Mrs.
Bobbsey of the foreman.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” answered Jim. “It isn’t more
than a mile and the trail is plain. I’ll tell ’em
how to go and show ’em the way.”
</p>
<p>
And so, the next morning, Bert and Nan
started off on a chestnut party, little dreaming
of the strange things that were to happen to
them and the other Bobbsey twins.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—SAWMILL FUN</h2>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie had teased to be allowed
to go nutting with Bert and Nan, especially
when the smaller Bobbsey twins learned
that their brother and sister were to take a
lunch and perhaps stay all the rest of the day
in the woods.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I want to go nutting!” cried Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“So do I!” wailed Freddie. “An’ I want
to eat my dinner under the Christmas trees!”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t have any fun if they come with
us,” objected Bert, in a whisper to his mother.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll take them some other time,” added
Nan. “They’d get tired and want to come
back before we found any nuts, Mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Mrs. Bobbsey, “perhaps they
would. You can take them some other time,
I suppose.” Then, as she knew Flossie and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
Freddie would be disappointed, Mrs. Bobbsey
called to them:
</p>
<p>
“Come, little twins, we’ll go down to the
sawmill and see the big logs sawed up into
boards. Maybe you can ride on the log carriers.”
</p>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie knew what this was,
and to them there was no better fun. Also
they liked to see the big, jagged-tooth saw
whizzing about and cutting its way through the
logs with such a queer, ripping, buzzing sound.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if we can go to the sawmill that will
be ’most as much fun as nutting,” agreed
Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Will you bring us some nuts?” asked
Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” promised Nan. “And next time we
go we’ll take you.”
</p>
<p>
So the nutting party was arranged. Taking
lunch was a sort of afterthought on the part of
Bert.
</p>
<p>
“What’ll we do if we get hungry?” he had
asked his mother.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll take something to eat in our pockets,”
Nan had said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to eat mine outside—sitting on
a log!” laughed Bert.
</p>
<p>
“Smarty!” laughed Nan. “I’ll catch you
next time!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Baxter put up for the children a good
lunch, more than enough for two meals, Mrs.
Bobbsey said.
</p>
<p>
“But we’ll get awful hungry in the woods,”
Bert remarked. “And we don’t want to have
to eat the nuts we get.”
</p>
<p>
True to his promise, Jim Denton, the foreman,
showed the older Bobbsey twins where to
take the path that led up along Pine Brook and
deeper into the forest about Cedar Camp, where
the chestnut trees were growing.
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye!” called Flossie and Freddie, as
they stood on the porch of the log cabin, waving
to Bert and Nan, who started off with their
lunch to be gone the rest of the day on the
nutting party.
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye,” echoed the older Bobbsey twins,
and then they were soon lost to sight in the
turn of the path along Pine Brook, which led
deeper into the North Woods.
</p>
<p>
“Now for some sawmill fun!” called Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
Bobbsey. “We’ll go down and see the little
saw chew up the big logs.”
</p>
<p>
In addition to sending to market logs for
telegraph poles and the masts of ships, Mr.
Bobbsey’s men in the North Woods also sawed
up trees into planks and boards which were
sold in the neighborhood. Besides this there
was the Christmas tree trade, but that only
took place at this time of year, around the
holidays.
</p>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie were too small to think
much about the missing Christmas trees, which
their father had come to camp to see about.
All they were anxious for was to have some
fun, and going to the sawmill was part of this.
</p>
<p>
The sawmill was farther down on Pine
Brook, where that stream widened out and was
dammed up to make a waterfall. Part of the
waterfall went through a flume, or sort of
wooden canal, and the water, falling down a
shaft, or wooden tunnel standing on end,
turned a turbine wheel.
</p>
<p>
A turbine wheel is quite different from the
ordinary mill wheel you may have seen. In
fact you can not see the turbine wheel at all,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
for it is closed in at the bottom of the water
shaft. It is small, but very powerful, and it
was this kind of wheel which turned the saw
machinery in Mr. Bobbsey’s Cedar Camp mill.
</p>
<p>
Before the smaller Bobbsey twins reached
the mill they could hear the ripping, tearing
sound of the saw as it cut its way through the
logs, slicing them into boards as your mother
slices the loaf of bread with the carving knife.
</p>
<p>
“Good morning, Mrs. Bobbsey—also little
twins!” called Foreman Tom Case, who had
charge of the sawmill. “Did you come to buy
some lumber this morning?”
</p>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie knew Tom Case, for he
had, at one time, worked in the lumberyard
of their father in Lakeport, so it was meeting
an old friend to see him here.
</p>
<p>
“Do you want one or two million feet this
morning, Flossie?” asked the jolly sawman.
“And will you take it with you or have it sent?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess we’ll just take some sawdust for
Flossie’s doll,” laughed Freddie. This was a
standing joke between the sawmill man and the
little twins. Tom Case was always trying to
sell a big lot of lumber to Flossie and Freddie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
and they always said all they wanted was a
little sawdust.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, shucks! you aren’t any kind of customers
to have around a lumber camp,” laughed
Mr. Case. “Where’s the rest of the family?”
he asked Mrs. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“Bert and Nan have gone nutting,” their
mother answered. “So we came down here to
see what was going on.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’re sawing up a lot of logs to-day,”
said the head man of the mill. “Here, you
twins sit right down on this soft place, and
you can watch everything.” Mr. Case spread
a horse blanket on top of a pile of soft, fragrant
sawdust, and on this Mrs. Bobbsey and
the smaller twins sat down.
</p>
<p>
They saw the lumber men float logs down
into the pond at one side of the dam and near
the flume through which the water dropped
to turn the turbine wheel. Into these logs a
big iron hook was driven. The hook was fast
to a chain, and the chain was wound around
a drum, or big roller.
</p>
<p>
When a man threw over a lever that started
the machinery, the drum turned, the chain was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
wound up and the log was pulled from the
water up on land and ready to be put on the
moving carriage which fed it into the teeth
of the saw.
</p>
<p>
“Could we ride on the logs?” cried Flossie,
as she saw them pulled, or “snaked,” as it is
called, out of the pond and up on shore.
</p>
<p>
“Yes! Yes!” chimed in Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” his mother answered. “You
might roll off, and if the log turned over, and
got on your legs, it would break them. It
wouldn’t be safe—see there!”
</p>
<p>
One of the lumbermen had jumped on top
of a log that was being pulled along by the
chain. For a time he kept his balance, and
was given a ride. But as Mrs. Bobbsey cried
out, the log struck a stone and turned over,
and if the lumberman had not jumped he would
have been thrown.
</p>
<p>
He leaped to one side with a laugh, and ran
into the mill.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what might have happened to you,
only you might not have gotten off so easily,”
said Mrs. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to ride,” sighed Flossie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
“So would I!” added Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Let ’em ride on the log carriage. That’s
safe if they don’t get too near the saw, and
you can ride with them and watch,” said Tom
Case.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed Mrs. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
The log carriage was a movable platform
of framework, on which the logs rested as they
were sawed into boards. The logs were rolled
up on the carriage by men, when the machinery
had been stopped and the big buzz saw was no
longer whirring around. Once a log was fastened
in place, Tom Case pulled a lever, and
the turbine wheel began to turn the saw, and
also move forward the carriage. The carriage,
or framework carrying the log, moved slowly
forward by means of cogwheels underneath,
so that it fed the log into the teeth of the saw
which ripped off wide planks and boards.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bobbsey and the little twins sat on the
far end of the carriage, and began to ride forward
with it. Of course if they had stayed on
too long they would have been carried up
against the dangerous saw just as the log was.
But before this would happen they could step
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
off, as the carriage moved slowly, like an automobile
just before it stops.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, this is fun!” cried Flossie, as she
dragged her feet through little piles of sawdust.
</p>
<p>
“’Most as much fun as nutting!” agreed
Freddie. “I’m going to be a lumber-saw man
when I grow up.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you aren’t going to be a fireman?”
asked his mother, for that had been Freddie’s
great ambition.
</p>
<p>
“Nope; I’m going to have a sawmill,” he
decided. But as he changed his mind about
every other day concerning what he intended
to do when he grew up, his mother did not
take him seriously this time.
</p>
<p>
She and the twins rode on the log carriage
until the big tree length was almost sawed
through, and then she helped Flossie and Freddie
off. With a final zip and clatter the board
was sawed off the side of the log. Then the
carriage would move back its full length, the
log would be shifted over to enable the saw to
cut a new place, and the work would start
over again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
</p>
<p>
The log carriage moved backward, when no
sawing was being done, much faster than it
moved forward. And the little Bobbsey twins
liked this backward ride very much, as they
went fairly whizzing along.
</p>
<p>
“All aboard!” called Tom Case, as he prepared
to send the carriage on its return trip.
Mrs. Bobbsey and Flossie and Freddie took
their places.
</p>
<p>
There was a rattle and a rumble, and back
they shot, the twins shouting in glee and kicking
aside the piles of sawdust. Thus they had
great fun at the sawmill, and they did not
want to come away when the noon whistle blew
and it was time for lunch. For there was a
steam engine in Cedar Camp, as well as the
turbine wheel, and this steam engine had a
whistle which the engineer blew to tell the men
to stop for dinner.
</p>
<p>
After dinner Mrs. Bobbsey went to lie down,
and after cautioning Flossie and Freddie not
to go near the sawmill without her, she left
the smaller twins to amuse themselves near
the cabin. Their father was out with some
of his men looking after Christmas trees, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
as Bert and Nan had gone nutting, Flossie and
Freddie looked about to find some amusement
of their own.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s play sawmill!” proposed Freddie, as
he and Flossie wandered down near Pine
Brook, where it ran over the dam, making a
waterfall.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed the little girl. “But
what’ll we have for a saw?”
</p>
<p>
Freddie looked around and noticed a wheelbarrow
not far off.
</p>
<p>
“That’ll do,” he said. “We’ll turn it downside
up, and I’ll turn the wheel for a saw and
you can hold sticks against it and make believe
they’re being sawed up.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed Flossie. “That’ll make
a fine saw.”
</p>
<p>
They went over to the wheelbarrow, and
then a new idea came to Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Flossie!” he cried, “you sit in it and
I’ll wheel you down to the edge of the brook.
We’ll have our sawmill there, and make believe
to snake logs out of the water like Mr. Case
did.”
</p>
<p>
This suited Flossie exactly, and soon she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
taken her place in the wheelbarrow. Freddie
grasped the handles, but his sister was almost
more of a load than he had bargained for.
Still he was a sturdy little chap, and he managed
to stagger on, wheeling Flossie toward
the brook.
</p>
<p>
There was a smooth place on a little knoll
near the brook where Freddie intended to set
up his wheelbarrow sawmill. Toward this
place he wheeled Flossie, and all might have
gone well had it not been for the fact that the
ground was covered with those slippery pine
needles.
</p>
<p>
Freddie managed to wheel his sister up the
slope, and he was just going to set the barrow
down and tell Flossie to get out so he could
turn it over and make a saw of it, when his
feet slipped. He lurched forward, gave the
wheelbarrow a push, and, an instant later, it
turned over, and Flossie, sliding on the slippery,
brown pine needles, began to go down
the slope and straight toward the brook, just
back of the dam.
</p>
<p>
Freddie, too, sat down hard and suddenly,
but though the breath was knocked out of him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
for a moment, he managed to pick himself up
and to cry:
</p>
<p>
“Mother! Mother! Come quick! Flossie’s
fallen into the brook and she’ll be carried over
the dam!”
</p>
<p>
And, as he called, into the water at the foot
of the pine needle hill splashed poor Flossie
Bobbsey!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—A SUDDEN STORM</h2>
<p>
While Flossie and Freddie were having
such fun at the real sawmill, and before Freddie
had, by accident, upset Flossie down the pine
needle bank into the brook above the mill dam,
Bert and Nan were trudging along through the
woods on their way to the chestnut grove, about
which Jim Denton had told them.
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you glad we came to Cedar Camp,
Bert?” asked Nan.
</p>
<p>
“I sure am!” answered her brother. “It’s
like having two vacations in the same year.
We had fun out West, and we’ll have fun
here.”
</p>
<p>
“We can have a party when we get back,
and roast the chestnuts,” suggested Nan.
</p>
<p>
“I hope we get a lot,” went on Bert, kicking
aside the pine cones and dried leaves. “We’ll
want some for Flossie and Freddie.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and for daddy and mother,” added
Nan. “They like chestnuts, too.”
</p>
<p>
The day had started as a bright and sunny
one, though it was colder up here in the North
Woods than down in Lakeport. But Bert and
Nan were warmly dressed, and they were so
accustomed to being out of doors that a little
cold did not bother them.
</p>
<p>
But though the sun had shone brightly when
they had started on their nutting trip, they had
not gone far before the sky began to be overcast
with clouds. Not that Bert and Nan
minded this. They were too busy looking for
chestnut trees and thinking what a good time
they were having to mind the weather.
</p>
<p>
For it was fun just to walk through the
woods and breathe the sweet, spicy odors of
the pine and cedar trees. The ground underfoot
was thickly carpeted with dried leaves and
pine needles, so that the footfalls of the older
Bobbsey twins made scarcely any sound as
they walked along.
</p>
<p>
It was so quiet that the children heard many
sounds in the forest which was all about them.
They were following a path that led along Pine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
Brook, and Jim Denton had said that if they
kept to this path they would come after about
a mile’s walk to a grove of chestnut trees.
</p>
<p>
“And if you don’t find any nuts there, keep
on a little farther,” the lumberman had said.
“The squirrels and chipmunks can’t have taken
all of them.”
</p>
<p>
So interested were Bert and Nan that they
paid little attention to the weather. In fact,
they could scarcely see the sky at times. This
was because the cedar and other trees were so
thick overhead.
</p>
<p>
As they were going along the path where
the pine needles made a thicker carpet than
usual, Bert, who was in the lead, came to a
sudden stop.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked Nan, shifting
from one hand to the other the bundle of lunch
she carried.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I heard something,” said Bert
in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
A moment later there was no doubt of this,
for both he and his sister heard a grunting
noise in the bushes, and then they heard the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
rustle of dried leaves and the snapping of
twigs.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Bert! Maybe it’s a bear!” cried Nan,
clinging to her brother.
</p>
<p>
“A—a bear!” gasped Bert. He hardly knew
what else to say.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look!” gasped Nan. She pointed toward
a bush, and, coming out from under it,
was a little animal, somewhat larger than a
rabbit, but with different kind of fur, small
ears, and with a tail that seemed to have rings
of fur around it.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a little bear!” gasped Nan. “Oh, Bert!
we’d better run back to camp before the big
bear comes.”
</p>
<p>
Bert looked at the furry animal, whose bright
eyes peered at the Bobbsey twins, and then
Nan’s brother laughed.
</p>
<p>
“I know what it is!” he said. “It’s a raccoon.
I can tell by the rings on its tail.”
</p>
<p>
“A raccoon!” gasped Nan. “Will it—will
it hurt us?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” answered Bert, and this was borne
out a moment later, for with a snorting grunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
the raccoon turned and scurried away into the
bushes.
</p>
<p>
“There!” said Bert. “He’s gone!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad of it,” returned Nan, with a sigh
of relief. “I don’t like raccoons when I’m chestnutting.”
</p>
<p>
“They’re nice!” declared Bert. “I wish I
could see him again.”
</p>
<p>
But the raccoon did not show itself, probably
being just as much frightened at having
seen the Bobbsey twins as Nan was at getting
a glimpse of the ring-tailed creature.
</p>
<p>
Over this little fright, the Bobbsey twins
walked on again, and soon they had reached
the grove that the foreman had told them
about.
</p>
<p>
“This must be the place—there are chestnut
trees here,” said Bert. His father had taught
him how to tell the more common sorts of trees
by means of their leaves and bark.
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s look for chestnuts,” proposed
Nan.
</p>
<p>
With sticks the children began poking
among the leaves, turning them over, for the
little brown nuts, when the frost has popped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
them out of their prickly shells, have a great
trick of hiding under the leaves.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ve found one!” cried Nan. “Two—three!
Oh, Bert, I’ve found three!”
</p>
<p>
She held out her hand with three shining
brown nuts in it.
</p>
<p>
“Ought to be a lot more than that here,”
said Bert, still poking away among the leaves.
“There’s lots of trees and fresh burrs here. I
guess the squirrels and chipmunks have been
here too.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ve found two more! I’m beating
you!” laughed Nan, as she picked up more
nuts.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve found one, anyhow, and it’s a big one,”
cried Bert, as he picked up his first. “But
there aren’t as many as I thought there would
be.”
</p>
<p>
The children continued to pick up a few nuts
at a time, but there were not so many scattered
over the ground as the lumberman had
led them to expect.
</p>
<p>
“There’s the chap who’s been taking the
nuts!” suddenly cried Bert.
</p>
<p>
“Who?” asked Nan, looking up after stooping to pick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
two of the brown prizes from a
bursted burr.
</p>
<p>
“That squirrel!” cried Bert, pointing to one
of the big-tailed gray fellows, sitting on a tree
and looking down at the Bobbsey twins. “He
and the chipmunks can soon clean up a chestnut
grove.”
</p>
<p>
Just then a red squirrel, one of the most
noisy chatterers of the woods, caught sight of
the children and began to “scold” them. Oh,
what a racket he made, his thin tail jerking
from side to side as he gave his shrill cries!
Bert and Nan laughed at him.
</p>
<p>
“He’s had his share of nuts,” said Bert, “and
he’s mad ’cause we’re taking some, I guess.
But we aren’t getting as many as we’d like.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” agreed Nan. “Maybe if we go on
a little farther we’ll find more.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll try,” agreed Bert and, almost before
they knew it, the two children had wandered
some distance from the place where Mr. Denton
had told them to stop.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look! There’s a pile of nuts here!”
cried Nan, reaching another grove of chestnut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
trees. “The squirrels haven’t been here yet!
Goodie!”
</p>
<p>
This was evident, for it did not take long,
poking among the dried leaves, to show that
the chestnuts were quite thick on the ground.
In a short time Bert and Nan had half filled
the salt bags they had brought with them to
hold their spoils of the woods.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, this is great!” cried Nan, straightening
up after four or five minutes of picking nuts
from the ground.
</p>
<p>
“A little more of this and we’ll have enough,”
said her brother.
</p>
<p>
But just then Nan looked up at the sky,
which she could see through the overhead
trees, and what she saw in the heavens made
her exclaim:
</p>
<p>
“Bert, I believe it’s going to storm! Look
at the clouds! And it’s getting ever so much
colder, too!”
</p>
<p>
Indeed there was a chill in the air that had
not been present when the Bobbsey twins started
out that morning.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll go back in a few minutes,” Bert
suggested. But a little while after he had said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
this, there was a quick darkening of the air,
the wind began to blow, and, so suddenly as
to startle the children, they found themselves
enveloped in such a blinding, driving squall of
snow that they could not see ten feet on either
side!
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Bert!” cried Nan. “It’s a blizzard!
Oh, shall we ever get back to Cedar Camp and
to mother?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—OLD MRS. BIMBY</h2>
<p>
“Pooh!” exclaimed Bert Bobbsey, as he ran
through the half-blinding snowstorm toward
Nan. “This isn’t anything! It’s only what
they call a squall. I s’pose they call it that
because the wind howls, or squalls, like a baby.
Anyhow, I’m not afraid! It’s fun, I think!”
</p>
<p>
By this time he had reached Nan’s side, the
two having been separated when the sudden
storm burst. And now that Nan saw Bert
near her and noticed that he had his bag of
lunch, as she had hers, she took heart and said:
</p>
<p>
“Well, maybe it won’t be so bad if we can
find a place to stay, and can eat our dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course we can!” cried Bert. “There’s
lots of places to stay in these woods. We can
find a hollow tree! I’ll look for one!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t!” cried Nan, as Bert moved away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
from her. “I don’t want to go into a hollow
tree. There might be owls in ’em!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s so,” admitted Bert. “I’m not
afraid of owls,” he said quickly, “but of course
their claws could get tangled in your hair. I’ll
look for another place—or I can make a lean-to.
That’s what the lumbermen and hunters
do.”
</p>
<p>
“I think it would be just as easy to get under
one of the big, green Christmas trees,” suggested
Nan. “Look, hardly any snow falls
under them.”
</p>
<p>
She pointed to a large cedar tree near them,
and, as you may have noticed if you were ever
in the woods where these trees grow, scarcely
any snow drifts under their low-hanging
branches.
</p>
<p>
“That would be a regular tent for us,” said
Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Bert, peering through the
storm at the tree toward which his sister
pointed. “We could get under one of those.
But I think maybe we’d better not stand still.
Let’s walk on.”
</p>
<p>
“But toward home!” suggested Nan. “We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
oughtn’t to go any farther gathering nuts,
Bert.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I guess not,” he agreed. “Anyhow, we
have quite a lot. We’ll start back for Cedar
Camp. And when we get hungry we’ll stop
under a Christmas tree and eat. I’m beginning
to feel hungry now,” and Bert felt in his overcoat
pocket to make sure that the lunch, which
he had put there, was still safe. It was, he was
glad to find, and Nan had hers.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we’ll eat in a little while,” she said.
“But we’d better start back to camp.”
</p>
<p>
So the two older Bobbsey twins started off in
the blinding snowstorm, little realizing that
they were going directly away from camp instead
of toward it. The wind whipped the
snow into their faces, so that they could see
only a little way in advance. And as they
were in a strange woods, with only a small path
leading back to camp, it is no wonder they became
lost.
</p>
<p>
But we must not forget that we have left
Flossie and Freddie, the smaller Bobbsey twins,
in trouble. In playing sawmill Freddie had
tipped Flossie out of the wheelbarrow, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
the little girl had rolled down the slippery
pine-needle hill into the stream just above the
dam.
</p>
<p>
“Come quick! Come quick!” Freddie had
cried. “Flossie’ll go over the waterfall! Oh,
hurry, somebody!”
</p>
<p>
He knew enough about waterfalls to understand
that they were dangerous; that once a
boat or a person got into the current above the
falls they would be pulled along, and cast over,
to drop on the rocks below.
</p>
<p>
Poor Flossie was too frightened to cry. Besides,
as she fell in her head went under the
water, and you can’t call out when that happens.
Flossie could only gurgle.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, however, there were several lumbermen
on the bank of the stream, floating the
logs down to be snaked out by the hook and
chain, and sawed into boards. One of these
men, Jake Peterson, was nearest to Flossie
when the little girl tumbled into the stream.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get you out!” cried Mr. Peterson.
</p>
<p>
He dropped the big iron-pointed pole with
which he was pushing logs and ran toward the
little girl, while Freddie, trying to do all he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
could, slid down the slippery hill, as it was a
quicker way down than by running.
</p>
<p>
Into the water with his big rubber boots
waded Mr. Peterson, and it was not a quarter
of a minute after Flossie had fallen in before
she was lifted out.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh!” she managed to gasp and gurgle,
as she caught her breath, after swallowing some
of the ice-cold water. “Oh, am I dr-dr-drowned?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say not!” answered Mr. Peterson.
“You’ll be all right. I’ll take you to mother.”
</p>
<p>
By this time Mrs. Bobbsey and Mrs. Baxter
had rushed out of the log cabin, and Tom
Case came from his sawmill. Several other
lumbermen, hearing Freddie’s excited cries,
came running up, but there was nothing for
them to do, as Flossie was already rescued.
</p>
<p>
“What has happened?” cried Mrs. Bobbsey,
as she saw her little girl, dripping wet, in the
arms of Mr. Peterson.
</p>
<p>
“She fell in,” explained the lumberman.
“She wasn’t in more than a few seconds,
though. All she needs is dry clothes!”
</p>
<p>
“I—I dumped her in!” sobbed Freddie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
“But I didn’t mean to. We were playin’ sawmill
with the wheelbarrow, and I gave Flossie
a ride, an’ I slipped on the pine needles, and
she rolled down the hill.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, dear! You didn’t mean to,”
answered his mother, soothingly. “We must
get Flossie to bed and keep her warm so she
won’t take cold.”
</p>
<p>
With Mrs. Baxter’s help, this was soon done,
and in a short time after the accident Flossie
was sitting up in a warm bed, sipping hot lemonade
and eating crackers, while Freddie sat
near her, doing the same.
</p>
<p>
Unless Flossie caught cold there would be
no serious results from the accident. But Mrs.
Bobbsey used it as a lesson for Freddie, telling
him always to be careful when on a pine-needle-covered
hill, near the water especially.
</p>
<p>
Flossie was enjoying her importance now,
and she was begging her mother to tell her a
story, in which request Freddie joined, when
Mrs. Bobbsey, looking out of the window, was
surprised to see how dark the clouds had become
all of a sudden.
</p>
<p>
“I believe we are going to have a snowstorm,” she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
And a few minutes later
the snow came down so thick and fast that the
lumbermen had to stop work, because they
could not see where to drive the horses, nor
to guide the logs down the stream to the mill.
</p>
<p>
“My, what a storm!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey,
as she went to the window to look out.
“A regular blizzard!”
</p>
<p>
“We can have fun coasting down hill!”
laughed Freddie. “And Flossie can be out
to-morrow, can’t she, Mother?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I think so,” answered Mrs. Bobbsey,
hardly thinking of what she was saying. “I
hope Bert and Nan started back from the chestnut
grove before this storm broke,” she said.
“If they are out in this it will be dreadful! I
must see if daddy has come back,” she added,
for her husband had gone to see about the
missing Christmas trees. “If Bert and Nan
are out in this storm they will lose their way,
I’m sure.”
</p>
<p>
And this is just what Bert and Nan did.
Clutching their bundles of lunch, and with
their bags of chestnuts in their hands, the two
older Bobbsey twins were struggling onward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
through the storm. They were warmly dressed,
and it was not as cold as weather they had
often been out in before. But they had seldom
been out in a worse storm.
</p>
<p>
“Hadn’t we—maybe we’d better stop and
rest and eat something, Bert,” suggested Nan,
after a while.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we had,” he agreed, half out of
breath because it was hard work walking
uphill and against the wind. And almost before
they knew it the children were going up
a hill, though they did not remember having
come down one on their trip to the chestnut
grove.
</p>
<p>
They found a sheltered place under a big
cedar tree, and, crawling beneath its protecting
branches, they sat on the bare ground, where
there was, as yet, no snow. The white flakes
swirled and drifted all about them, but the
thick branches of the tree, growing low down,
made a place like a green tent.
</p>
<p>
“It’s nice in here,” said Bert, as he opened
his bundle of lunch.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but we ought to be at home,” said
Nan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll go home as soon as we eat a little,”
said her brother.
</p>
<p>
But after they had each eaten a sandwich
and some cookies, and Bert had cracked a few
chestnuts between his teeth and had found them
rather too cold and raw to be good, the twins
decided to go on.
</p>
<p>
Out into the storm they went, away from
the shelter of the friendly tree. The storm
was worse, if anything, and, without knowing
it, Bert and Nan had become completely turned
around. Every step they took carried them
farther and farther away from their home
camp. And they had journeyed quite a distance
from the cabin before finding any chestnuts.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Bert!” Nan exclaimed after a while,
half sobbing, “I can’t go a step farther. The
snow is so thick, and it’s so hard to walk in.
And the wind blows it in my face, and I’m
cold! I can’t go another step!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s too bad!” Bert exclaimed. “Maybe
we’re almost back to camp, Nan.”
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t look so,” his sister answered, trying
to peer about through the swirling flakes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minute!” suddenly cried Bert, as
there came a lull in the blast of wind. “I think
I see something—a cabin or a house.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s our cabin,” suggested Nan,
“though I don’t remember any of the trees
around here. There aren’t any cut down here
as there are in camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I see something, anyhow,” and Bert
pointed to the left, off through the driving
flakes. “Let’s go there, Nan.”
</p>
<p>
Through the storm the children struggled,
hand in hand. They reached a log cabin—a
lonely log cabin it was, standing all by itself
in the midst of a little clearing in the woods.
</p>
<p>
“This isn’t our camp, Bert!” said Nan.
</p>
<p>
“No,” the boy admitted. “But somebody
lives here. I see smoke coming from the chimney.
I’m going to knock.”
</p>
<p>
With chilled fingers Bert pounded on the
cabin door.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s there?” asked a woman’s voice
above the racket of the storm.
</p>
<p>
“Two of the Bobbsey twins!” answered Nan,
not stopping to think that everyone might not
know her and her brother by this name.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“Please let us in!” begged Bert. “We’re
from Cedar Camp! Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m Mrs. Bimby,” was the answer, but
neither Bert nor Nan recognized the name. A
moment later the cabin door was opened, and
an old woman confronted them. She looked
at the two children for a moment; then, “Did
you bring any news of Jim?” she asked.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—MR. BOBBSEY IS WORRIED</h2>
<p>
Bert and Nan Bobbsey stood on the step
of the log cabin, while Mrs. Bimby, the old
woman, held open the door. The snow blew
swirling in around her, and a wave of grateful
warmth seemed to rush out as if to wrap itself
around the cold twins. For a moment they
stood there, and Bert was just beginning to
wonder if the old woman was going to shut
the door in the faces of his sister and himself.
</p>
<p>
“Did you bring any news of Jim?” asked
old Mrs. Bimby.
</p>
<p>
“Jim?” repeated Bert.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean Jim Denton, the foreman at
Cedar Camp?” asked Nan.
</p>
<p>
“No, child! I mean my Jim—Jim Bimby.
He went off to town just before this awful
storm. But land sakes! here I am talking and
keeping you out in the cold. Come in!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
It was cold. Bert and Nan were beginning
to feel that now, for the storm was growing
worse, and it was now late afternoon. The sun
was beginning to go down, though of course
it could not be seen on account of the snow
and clouds. The Bobbsey twins had wandered
farther and longer than they had thought. But
at last they had found a place of shelter.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just like me to keep you standing there
while I talk,” said Mrs. Bimby. “I’m sorry.
But I’m so worried about Jim that I reckon I
don’t know what I’m doing. Come in and
get warm, and I’ll give you something to eat.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got something to eat, thank you,”
said Nan. “But we would like to get warm,”
and she followed Bert inside the log cabin, as
Mrs. Bimby stepped aside to make room for
them to enter.
</p>
<p>
“Got something to eat, have you?” questioned
the old woman. “Well, you’re lucky,
that’s all I’ve got to say. I’ve only a little, but
I expect Jim back any minute with more,
though a dollar don’t buy an awful lot these
days.”
</p>
<p>
“Does Jim live here?” asked Bert, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
walked over to a stove, in which a fire of wood
was burning, sending out a grateful heat.
</p>
<p>
“Of course he lives here,” said Mrs. Bimby.
“He’s my husband. He’s a logger—a lumberman.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, maybe he works for my father!” exclaimed
Nan. “Mr. Bobbsey, you know. He
owns part of Cedar Camp.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t know him,” said Mrs. Bimby,
“though I’ve heard of Cedar Camp. They got
a lot of Christmas trees out of there.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what we came up about,” explained
Bert. “Some Christmas trees my father bought
to sell didn’t come to Lakeport, and he came
up here to see about them. We came with
him—and my mother and the other twins.”
</p>
<p>
“Good land! are there more of you?” asked
Mrs. Bimby in surprise. “You two are twins,
for a fact. But——”
</p>
<p>
“There’s Flossie and Freddie,” interrupted
Nan. “We left them back in camp while we
went after chestnuts.”
</p>
<p>
“We got some, too,” added Bert. “But we
sort of got lost in the storm. Do you s’pose
your husband could take us back to Cedar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
Camp?” he asked Mrs. Bimby. “My father
will pay him,” he said, quickly, as he saw Mrs.
Bimby shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe Mr. Bimby works at the sawmill,”
suggested Nan.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the old woman, “Jim is a logger
and wood cutter, but he doesn’t work at Cedar
Camp. That’s too far off for him to go to and
get back from.”
</p>
<p>
“Too far off!” echoed Nan, and she began
to have a funny feeling, as she told Bert afterward.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” resumed Mrs. Bimby. “Cedar Camp
is away over on the other side of the hills.
You’re a long way from home. You must have
taken the wrong road in the storm.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess we did,” admitted Bert. “But
couldn’t your husband take us back?”
</p>
<p>
Again Mrs. Bimby shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“Jim, my husband, isn’t home,” she said.
“He went over to town just before the storm
to get us something to eat. But now I don’t
see how he’s going to get back,” and she went
to a window to look out at the storm.
</p>
<p>
It was getting much worse, as Bert and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
Nan could see. The wind howled around the
corners of the log cabin of Jim Bimby, the
logger, and the blast whistled down the chimney,
even blowing sparks out around the door
of the wood-burning stove.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s a bad storm,” went on the old
woman. “I wish Jim was back, and with some
victuals to eat. When you twins knocked I
thought it was Jim. I wish he’d come back,
but he’s an old man, and he may fall down in
the snow and not be able to get up. He isn’t
as strong as he used to be. I’m certainly worried
about Jim!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, maybe he’ll come along all right,” said
Nan, trying to be helpful and comforting.
</p>
<p>
“If he doesn’t pretty soon it’ll be night, and
in all this storm he never can find his way after
dark. But you children take your things off
and sit up and have a cup of tea with me. I’ve
got some tea and condensed milk left, anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t take tea unless it’s very weak,”
said Nan, remembering her mother’s rule in
this respect.
</p>
<p>
“All right, dearie, I’ll make it weak for you
twins, though I like it strong myself,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
Mrs. Bimby. “My, what a storm! <em>What</em> a
storm!” and she drew her shawl more closely
around her shoulders as the wind howled down
the chimney.
</p>
<p>
Bert and Nan took off their warm things,
laying their packages of lunch and the bags of
chestnuts on the table. Nan saw the old woman
go to a closet, and the glimpse the Bobbsey
girl had of the shelves showed her that they
contained only a little food.
</p>
<p>
“Bert and I have some of our lunch left,”
said Nan.
</p>
<p>
“And you can have some, if you want to,”
went on Bert. “We put up a pretty good
lunch, and there’s more’n half of it left.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless your hearts, my dears,” said Mrs.
Bimby. “I wouldn’t take your lunch. You’ll
need it yourselves. I’ve a little victuals left
in the house, though if my Jim doesn’t get
back soon there won’t be much for to-morrow.
My, what a storm! What a storm!”
</p>
<p>
The small log cabin seemed to shake and
tremble in the wind, as though it would blow
away. And the snow was now coming down
so thickly that Bert and Nan could see only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
a short distance out of the window. There
was little to see, anyhow, save trees and bushes,
and these were fast becoming covered with
snow.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bimby busied herself about the stove,
putting the kettle on so she could make tea, and
Bert and Nan watched her. The Bobbsey twins
were wondering what would happen, how they
could get home, and whether or not their
father and mother would worry. Nan looked
about the cabin. She did not see any beds, but
a steep flight of stairs, leading up to what
seemed to be a second story, might provide
bedrooms, Nan thought. The cabin was clean
and neat, and she was glad of that.
</p>
<p>
“I do hope Jim comes,” murmured Mrs.
Bimby, as she poured the boiling water on
the dry tea leaves in the pot. “I do hope he
isn’t storm-bound!”
</p>
<p>
Bert and Nan hoped the same thing, for,
somehow, Bert thought if Mr. Bimby came
along he would take the twins back to Cedar
Camp.
</p>
<p>
“Now sit up, dearies, and have some weak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
tea, and I’ll take mine strong. I need it for
my nerves,” said the old woman.
</p>
<p>
And while Bert and Nan had thus found
shelter from what turned out to be one of the
worst storms ever remembered in the country
around Cedar Camp, the other Bobbsey twins,
Flossie and Freddie, were safe at home with
their mother. Flossie was now cozy and warm
after her dip into the water.
</p>
<p>
“There’s your father!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bobbsey, as she heard someone stamping off
the snow at the front door. “I hope he has
Bert and Nan with him.”
</p>
<p>
But when Mr. Bobbsey came in alone and
heard that the older twins had not come back
from their nutting trip, a worried look came
over his face.
</p>
<p>
“Not back yet!” he exclaimed. “Why, it’s
getting dark and the storm is growing worse!
I must start out after them with some of the
lumbermen. They must be lost!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—OLD JIM</h2>
<p>
“Don’t you think Bert and Nan will be
along in a little while?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey
of her husband, as she crossed the big front
room in the log cabin to meet him.
</p>
<p>
“Be in <em>soon</em>!” he exclaimed. “Why, they’ve
been gone too long now, and——”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bobbsey, not letting Flossie and Freddie
see her, made a motion with her hands
toward her husband. Then he understood that
his wife did not want him to frighten the
smaller twins by letting it become known how
worried he was about Bert and Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—yes,” said Mr. Bobbsey, as he understood
his wife’s idea. “Oh, yes, Bert and Nan
will be along soon now.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be glad!” exclaimed Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“So will I,” added Flossie, from her place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
on one of the bunks in a bedroom opening out
of the living room. “I want some chestnuts.”
</p>
<p>
“Hello, little Fat Fairy! what’s the matter
with you?” asked her father, noticing for the
first time that Flossie was in bed. “Sick?” he
asked.
</p>
<p>
“I just fell in the water,” Flossie explained.
</p>
<p>
“I dumped her in, but I didn’t mean to,”
Freddie said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Up to some of your fireman tricks,
were you?” laughed Mr. Bobbsey, for he saw,
by a glance at his wife, that the small twins
were now in no danger.
</p>
<p>
“No, Daddy, I wasn’t playing fireman,”
Freddie answered, though that was one of his
favorite pastimes. “We were going to make a
sawmill.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey. “Well,
whatever you do, keep away from the big buzz
saw,” he warned. “And now,” he went on in
a low voice to his wife, so Freddie and Flossie
would not hear, “we must do something about
Bert and Nan.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she agreed. “I’m worried about
them, but I didn’t want Flossie and Freddie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
to know. Oh, to think of their being out in
this storm!”
</p>
<p>
“It is pretty bad,” her husband admitted.
“I was caught in it, and hurried back. I didn’t
think the children would go far away.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” said Mrs. Bobbsey. “I suppose
they didn’t find chestnuts where they expected
to, and wandered on. Are there any wild animals
in the woods?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no, none to speak of,” her husband
said slowly. “You don’t need to worry about
that. But I’ll get Jim Denton, and some of
the men, and we’ll start right out after Bert
and Nan.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I could come with you!” exclaimed
his wife, as anxious and worried as was Mr.
Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to stay here with Flossie and
Freddie,” he said. “I’ll soon find Bert and
Nan and bring them back.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” murmured his wife, but as she
glanced out of the window and saw how dark
it was getting and how fast the snow still came
down and heard how the wind howled, it is
no wonder the mother of the older Bobbsey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
twins was worried. So was Mr. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go right away and get Jim and some of
the men, and we’ll start out on the search,”
said Mr. Bobbsey, having warmed himself at
the stove. “We must not wait!”
</p>
<p>
“No,” agreed Mrs. Bobbsey. “I’ll stay and
amuse Flossie and Freddie.”
</p>
<p>
The smaller Bobbsey twins, of course, did
not worry because Bert and Nan had not yet
come home. Flossie and Freddie were having
too much fun playing a little game on the foot
of Flossie’s bed. Mrs. Baxter, the housekeeper,
had started the game for the children by bringing
in some funny wooden blocks her husband
had cut out on one of the long winter evenings
that were sometimes so dreary in Cedar Camp.
</p>
<p>
The blocks could be fitted together to make
a house, a bridge, a boat and many other play
objects, and Flossie and Freddie enjoyed playing
with them, for which their mother was
glad. She really was so worried that she could
not very well talk to them or tell them stories.
</p>
<p>
Telling his wife to keep up her courage and
not to worry too much, Mr. Bobbsey went out
into the storm again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where is daddy going?” asked Flossie, hearing
the door shut.
</p>
<p>
“He’s going to bring back Bert and Nan—and
the chestnuts,” said Mrs. Bobbsey, quickly.
She knew the smaller twins would think more
of the chestnuts than anything else, just at
present.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I like chestnuts!” cried Freddie. “I’m
going to boast ’em an’ roil ’em!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Listen to him, Mother!” laughed Flossie.
“He said ‘boast an’ roil,’ an’ he meant roast
an’ boil ’em, didn’t he?”
</p>
<p>
“I think he did,” said Mrs. Bobbsey, trying
not to let the small twins see how worried she
was.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Freddie Bobbsey, look what you did!”
suddenly cried Flossie. “You knocked over
my steamboat!” For Freddie had toppled over
the pile of blocks that Flossie had erected on
the foot of her bed.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind. He didn’t mean to,” said
Mrs. Bobbsey. “You can make another boat,
Flossie.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ I’ll help,” offered Freddie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
Thus the two smaller Bobbsey twins amused
themselves, with little thought of Bert and Nan
except, perhaps, to wonder when they would
come home with the chestnuts.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Mr. Bobbsey hurried through
the fast-gathering darkness and the storm to
the cabin of Jim Denton. Like the other men
in the Christmas tree and lumber camp, the
foreman had stopped work when the storm
came with such blinding snow and a wind that
turned bitter cold toward night.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” cried Jim Denton, when
Mr. Bobbsey called at his cabin. “Bert and
Nan not back from chestnutting yet? Why, I
s’posed they were back hours ago!”
</p>
<p>
“So did I, and I wish they were,” said Mr.
Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, shucks now! don’t worry,” said the
jolly foreman. “We’ll find ’em all right.
We’ll start right out.”
</p>
<p>
He put on his big boots and warm coat and
went with Mr. Bobbsey to the cabins of some
of the lumbermen. Soon a searching party
was organized, and away they started through
the storm along the path that earlier in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
day Bert and Nan had taken to go to the chestnut
grove.
</p>
<p>
“They took their lunch with them,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, “so they wouldn’t be hungry until
now. But they may be lost or have fallen into
some hole and be half snowed over.”
</p>
<p>
“Or they may have found some logger’s or
hunter’s cabin, and have gone in,” said Jim
Denton. “There are plenty of cabins scattered
through these woods.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope they have found shelter,” said Mr.
Bobbsey anxiously.
</p>
<p>
On through the storm went the father of
the Bobbsey twins and his lumbermen searchers.
They stopped now and then and shouted,
but no answers came back.
</p>
<p>
They had been out about an hour, and had
gone more than a mile along the path that it
was supposed Bert and Nan had taken, when
one of the men called:
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minute! I think I heard someone
call.”
</p>
<p>
They all stopped and listened. Above the
blowing of the wind and the swishing of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
fast-falling snowflakes, a faint and far-off voice
could be heard.
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help!” it called.
</p>
<p>
“There they are!” shouted one of the lumbermen.
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t sound like either Bert or Nan,”
said Mr. Bobbsey. “But it may be someone
who started to bring them back to camp and
he, too, became lost.”
</p>
<p>
They all listened again, and once more came
the call, but still faint and far away.
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s over here!” cried Jim Denton. “Over
to the right!”
</p>
<p>
Through the storm and darkness the rescue
party hurried, sending out calls to tell that
they were on the way. Now and again they
heard the cry in answer, and it sounded nearer
now.
</p>
<p>
At last Mr. Bobbsey saw a dark figure huddled
in a heap near a pile of snow, which had
drifted around a large rock.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s someone!” cried Mr. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
A moment later he and the lumbermen were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
standing over the figure of a man, partly buried
in the snow.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s Jim! Old Jim Bimby!” exclaimed
Jim Denton. “I know him. He lives several
miles from here. He must have been lost in
the storm, too. Jim! Jim!” he cried. “What
you doing here?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I started to town for victuals,” said old
Jim Bimby, in faint tones. “The storm was
too much for me. I was about giving up.”
</p>
<p>
“We heard you call,” said Tom Case.
</p>
<p>
“Did you see anything of two small children?”
eagerly asked Mr. Bobbsey. “Twins,
a boy and a girl! Did you see them?”
</p>
<p>
Anxiously he bent over to catch the old
logger’s answer.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—SNOWED IN</h2>
<p>
Having been out in the cold and storm so
long, Jim Bimby seemed to have become half
frozen. He did not appear to understand what
Mr. Bobbsey asked him. The old logger staggered
to his feet, helped by some of the men
from Cedar Camp, and looked about him.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked Old Jim in a
faint voice. “Did something happen? I remember
startin’ off to get—to get something
to eat for my wife and me. Then I fell down,
tired out, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you did!” exclaimed Tom Case.
“And if we hadn’t found you, you’d have been
done for. We must get you to shelter.”
</p>
<p>
“Take him around behind this big pine tree
a minute,” suggested Jim Denton. “He’ll be
out of the wind there, and we can give him a
drink of the hot tea we brought along.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
Some hot tea, mixed with milk, had been put
in a thermos bottle and taken with the party
to have ready for Nan and Bert, should the
Bobbsey twins be found. Now this hot drink
would do for poor old Jim Bimby.
</p>
<p>
Some of the men managed to light lanterns
they carried, though it was hard work on account
of the wind and snow, and the whole
party, including the rescued man, went to the
side of the big pine tree, which kept off some
of the storm.
</p>
<p>
“There! I feel better,” said Old Jim, as he
swallowed the warm drink.
</p>
<p>
“And now can you tell us whether or not
you saw my two children, Nan and Bert—the
Bobbsey twins?” again asked their father anxiously.
</p>
<p>
Old Jim shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“No,” he answered. “I didn’t see any children.
I came straight from my cabin, over
the hill trail, to go to the village to get some
food. The cupboard is almost bare at my
house. I didn’t think it was goin’ to storm, and
I was all taken aback when it did. I kept on,
but I must have lost my way.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“Guess you did,” said Mr. Peterson. “And
you’re not likely to get back on it in this storm,
either.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” cried Old Jim. “You mean to say
I can’t keep on to the store and take some food
back to my wife?”
</p>
<p>
“Not in this storm!” said Tom Case.
“You’re miles from the store now, and more
miles from your cabin. You’d best come to
Cedar Camp with us, and in the morning, when
the storm is over, you can go on again. Your
wife has enough food to last until morning,
hasn’t she?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I guess so,” answered Mr. Bimby.
</p>
<p>
“But what has become of Bert and Nan?”
asked Mr. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“Now look here, Mr. Bobbsey,” said Tom
Case, “don’t go to worrying about those children.
They’re all right. Bert and Nan are
smart, and when they saw this storm coming
on they went to some shelter, you can depend
on that. They’d know better than to try to
make their way back to camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, perhaps they would,” admitted the
father of the missing twins. “And perhaps,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
when we get back to camp, we’ll find them
there. Some logger or hunter may have found
them and taken them to our cabin.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” agreed Mr. Peterson.
</p>
<p>
By this time “Old Jim,” as he was called, to
distinguish him from Jim Denton, the lumber
foreman, was feeling much better. He was
still weak, and he leaned on the arm of one of
the lumbermen as they turned back. The
storm was still fierce, and it was now night,
but lanterns gave light enough to see the way
through the forest.
</p>
<p>
Had it not been that the lumber and Christmas
tree men knew their way through the
woods, the party might never have reached
Cedar Camp. As it was they lost the trail
once, and had hard work to find it again. But
finally they plunged through several drifts of
snow that had formed, and broke out into the
clearing around the sawmill.
</p>
<p>
“Did you find them?” cried Mrs. Bobbsey,
when her husband came to the cabin, knocking
the snow off his feet.
</p>
<p>
“No,” he answered, and he tried to make
his voice as cheerful as possible. “We didn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
find them, but they’re all right. They were
probably taken in by some hunter or logger.”
</p>
<p>
Even as he said this Mr. Bobbsey was disappointed
that Bert and Nan had not been
brought back to camp during his absence, for
he had half hoped that he would find them
there on his own return.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do hope they’re all right!” said Mrs.
Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“Of course they are!” her husband told her.
“They’ll be here in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
“With chestnuts?” asked Flossie, who, with
Freddie, had been awakened from an early
evening sleep by the return of their father.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, they’ll bring chestnuts,” replied Mr.
Bobbsey, trying to smile, though it was hard
work, for he was really very much worried,
as was his wife.
</p>
<p>
However, they did not let Flossie and Freddie
know this. And as Mr. Bobbsey ate the
warm supper which Mrs. Baxter set out for
him, he told about the finding of Mr. Bimby,
who had been taken to the cabin of Tom Case,
there to spend the night.
</p>
<p>
“Can we see him?” cried Flossie, who did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
not seem any the worse for having fallen into
the water.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he can tell us a story about a real
bear,” added Freddie, for he had been rather
disappointed, since coming to Cedar Camp, because
no one could tell him where to find a
bear.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he can,” said his father. “You shall
see Old Jim, as the boys call him, in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey did not pass a very
happy night. They were much worried about
the missing Nan and Bert, and though he tried
to sleep, after Flossie and Freddie had gone
to Slumberland, Mr. Bobbsey found it hard
work. So did his wife.
</p>
<p>
More than once during the night, as they
awakened after fitful naps and heard the wind
howling around the cabin and the snow rattling
against the windows, one or the other would
say:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I hope Bert and Nan are all right!”
</p>
<p>
And the other would say:
</p>
<p>
“I hope so!”
</p>
<p>
Morning came at last, but it was not such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
morning as all in Cedar Camp had hoped for.
They had expected the storm to be over, so
that a searching party could again set out to
find Bert and Nan.
</p>
<p>
But instead of the storm being over, it was
even worse than the night before. A regular
blizzard had set in, the snow coming out of
the north on the wings of a cold wind. Great
drifts were piled high here and there through
the camp clearing, and when Freddie and Flossie
looked from the window they could hardly
see the sawmill.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh!” squealed Freddie. “Look, Flossie!
Just look!”
</p>
<p>
“We’re snowed in!” cried Flossie. “Oh,
what fun we’ll have!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s just like Snow Lodge!” added Freddie,
remembering a time spent there, when several
adventurous happenings had taken place.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’m afraid we are snowed in,” said
Mr. Bobbsey, with an anxious look out of the
window. “But I hope it will not last long.
Well, here come Tom Case and Old Jim. I
must see what they want,” and he went to the
door to let them in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the snow came down steadily, and
as Flossie had said, that part of the Bobbsey
family at Cedar Camp was fairly snowed in.
As for the other members of the family, Bert
and Nan, we must now try to find out what had
happened to them.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—A BARE CUPBOARD</h2>
<p>
Having finished drinking the weak tea
which Mrs. Bimby brewed for them, eating
with it some of the lunch they had brought
along, Bert and Nan sat in the lonely cabin in
the woods wondering what would happen next.
There was no other cabin or house near them,
and as they heard the wind howl down the
chimney and moan around the corners, and
heard the rattle of hard snow against the window,
the older Bobbsey twins were glad they
had found this shelter.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think we’ll be able to start back
soon, Mrs. Bimby?” asked Nan, as she helped
the old woman clear the tea things off the
table.
</p>
<p>
“Back where, dearie?”
</p>
<p>
“Back to our camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, not to-night, surely,” said Mrs. Bimby.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
“You won’t dare venture out in this storm.
It’s getting worse, and black night is coming
on. You just stay here with me. I can make
up beds for you, and I’ll be glad to have you,
since my Jim isn’t coming back, I reckon.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you think has become of him?”
asked Bert, who was interested in looking at a
gun that hung over the mantel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I reckon he got to the village, but
found the storm so bad he didn’t dare to start
back,” answered Mrs. Bimby.
</p>
<p>
Of course she did not know what had happened
to Old Jim any more than Jim knew that
the older Bobbsey twins were in his own cabin.
</p>
<p>
“But Jim’ll be here in the morning,” said
his wife. “And I do hope he’ll bring in something
to eat. If he doesn’t——”
</p>
<p>
She did not finish what she started to say,
and Nan asked:
</p>
<p>
“Will you starve, Mrs. Bimby?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, not exactly <em>starve</em>, for I s’pose a body
could keep alive on tea and condensed milk
for a while. But we’ll be pretty hungry.
There’ll be three to feed instead of just one,”
the old woman went on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ve some food left,” said Bert. “And
we can cook our chestnuts. We got quite a
few before the storm came.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless your hearts, dearies!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bimby. “You may be able to eat chestnuts,
but <em>my</em> old teeth are too poor for that. But
I dare say we’ll get along somehow, even if
the cupboard is almost bare. Don’t you want
to go to bed?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s too early,” objected Bert.
</p>
<p>
“Have you any games we could play?” asked
Nan.
</p>
<p>
She and her brother were in the habit of
playing simple games at home before going to
bed, and it seemed natural to do it now. After
the first shock of feeling that they were lost in
the snow storm had passed, the Bobbsey twins
were quite content. They felt that their father
and mother must realize that they were safe.
</p>
<p>
“Games, dearie?” asked Mrs. Bimby. “Well,
seems to me there’s some dominoes around
somewhere, and I did see a checker board the
other day. Jim used to play ’em when the
loggers came in. I’ll see if I can dig ’em out.”
</p>
<p>
She rummaged through an old chest and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
brought to light a box of battered dominoes.
But as several were missing it was hard to play
a good game with them. As for the checkers,
the board was there but the pieces, or men,
were not to be found.
</p>
<p>
“But you can take kernels of corn,” said
Mrs. Bimby. “I’ve often seen my Jim do
that.”
</p>
<p>
“Checker men have to be of different color,”
said Nan, “and corn is all one color, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“There are red ears,” suggested Bert.
“Don’t you remember we saw some when we
were in the country?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Nan.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I was going to say,” remarked
Mrs. Bimby. “I can give you some yellow
kernels and some red ones, and you can play
checkers if you like.”
</p>
<p>
This suited Nan and Bert, and though it was
hard to make “kings” by placing one grain of
corn on top of another, they managed to go
on with the game, using pins to fasten two red
or two yellow kernels one on top of the other
when the king row was reached.
</p>
<p>
Grains of corn or some other cereal, or perhaps colored
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
stones, were, very likely, the first
sort of “men” used in the ancient game of
checkers, and Bert and Nan got along very
well in this way. Mrs. Bimby kept stoking the
fire, putting on stick after stick of wood as it
burned away, and the cabin was kept warm and
cozy.
</p>
<p>
Outside the storm raged, the wind blew, and
the snow came pelting down. But at times the
older Bobbsey twins were so interested in their
checker game that they hardly heard the sounds
outside the log cabin.
</p>
<p>
At last Mrs. Bimby, with a look at the clock,
said:
</p>
<p>
“It’s after nine, dearies; hadn’t you better
go to bed? My Jim won’t come to-night, that’s
sure, and I don’t believe any of your folks
will come for you.”
</p>
<p>
“They don’t know where we are,” said Nan.
</p>
<p>
“No more they do, dearie. Well, I’ll show
you where you’re to sleep. I’m glad I’ve got
covers enough for two extra beds.”
</p>
<p>
There were three rooms in the second story
of the log cabin. Two of the rooms were small,
each one containing a little single cot. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
other room was larger, and had a bed in it.
Mrs. Bimby slept there, and she gave Bert and
Nan each one of the smaller rooms. There
was a window in each of the bedrooms, and
being above the warm downstairs room, where
a hot fire had been blazing all evening, the
sleeping chambers were more comfortable than
one would have supposed.
</p>
<p>
Bert and Nan were so sleepy that they did
not lie awake long after getting to bed. As
there were no pajamas for Bert and no night-gown
for Nan, the children slept in their underclothes,
taking off only their shoes and
outer garments.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the fact that he fell asleep soon
after going to bed, because he was tired from
the day’s tramp after chestnuts, Bert was
awakened in the middle of the night by hearing
Nan call:
</p>
<p>
“Mother, please give me a drink!”
</p>
<p>
It was a request Bert had often heard his
sister make before, and now he realized that
she was either half awake, and did not remember
where she was, or else she was talking in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
her sleep. He raised up on his elbow and listened.
Again Nan said:
</p>
<p>
“I want a drink!”
</p>
<p>
Bert knew how hard it was to try to go to
sleep when thirsty, so he got up and, having
noticed on coming to bed the evening before
a pail of water on a chair in the upper hall,
he brought Nan a dipper full. Mrs. Bimby had
left a lantern burning, so it was not dark in
the cabin.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Bert! I dreamed I was back home,”
said Nan, as she took the drink her brother
handed her. “Thank you!”
</p>
<p>
“Welcome,” he said, struggling to keep his
sleepy eyes open.
</p>
<p>
“Is it still snowing?” asked Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Hard,” answered Bert, looking out of the
window, though, truth to tell, he could see
nothing, it was so pitch dark outside. But he
could hear the rattle of snow against the glass.
</p>
<p>
“I hope it stops by morning,” sighed Nan.
</p>
<p>
“So do I—long enough for us to get back
to camp, anyhow,” added Bert.
</p>
<p>
He got himself a drink and went back to
bed, there to sleep soundly until morning, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
Mrs. Bimby called him and Nan to get up.
</p>
<p>
“Come, dearies,” said the kind old woman.
“We’ll have breakfast, such as it is.”
</p>
<p>
For a few moments after awakening Bert
and Nan could not quite remember where they
were. Bert afterward said that he hoped there
would be hot buckwheat cakes for breakfast,
with maple syrup, such as they had had in the
cabin where Mrs. Baxter acted as cook. But
there was no such appetizing smell as that of
pancakes coming up from Mrs. Bimby’s
kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry I haven’t any more to offer you,”
she said to the children, as she set before them
some more weak tea and a few pieces of bread
and butter. “If my Jim had come back we’d
have had enough to eat. But as it is, I’m
afraid you’ll go hungry soon.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll eat what’s left of our lunch,” said
Bert.
</p>
<p>
“And cook some chestnuts,” added Nan.
“We’ll pretend we’ve been shipwrecked. Were
you ever shipwrecked, Mrs. Bimby?” Nan
asked, as cheerfully as she could.
</p>
<p>
“No, dearie, but I’ve had the rheumatiz, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
I reckon that’s ’most as bad. But let’s eat
what we’ve got and we’ll hope for more before
the day is over.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s still snowing, isn’t it?” remarked Nan,
as she hungrily ate some of the dry food and
swallowed some of the weak, but warm, tea.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and it’s likely to keep up all day,”
said Mrs. Bimby. “It’ll be hip-deep by night,
and we’ll be completely snowed in. I declare, I
don’t know what we’ll do!”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’ll stop,” suggested Bert, trying
to look on the bright side.
</p>
<p>
“Or maybe it won’t be so bad but what we
can go out,” added Nan. “And if we get back
to camp we can send you something to eat by
one of the men in a sleigh, Mrs. Bimby.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t let you go out in this storm—not
for anything!” declared the kind old woman.
“The only safe place is this cabin when
it snows this way. You can’t starve to death
as quickly as you can freeze to death, that’s a
comfort. And we’ve got enough for one more
meal, anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
But when noon came, after a long morning,
during which the Bobbsey twins played more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
checker games with grains of corn, and when
almost all there was in the cupboard had been
eaten, Mrs. Bimby opened the doors, looked at
the bare shelves and said:
</p>
<p>
“I declare, I don’t know what we’re going to
do! Almost everything is gone!”
</p>
<p>
The cupboard, indeed, was nearly bare.
</p>
<p>
For some reason or other, Bert’s eyes rested
on the gun on the wall over the mantel.
</p>
<p>
“Is that gun loaded, Mrs. Bimby?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I reckon ’tis,” she answered. “Jim
always keeps it loaded, for he goes hunting
sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
“What after?” asked Bert.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, squirrels and rabbits.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I’m going to do, then!” cried
Bert. “If I could shoot some squirrels or rabbits
we’d have a potpie and we wouldn’t be
hungry. Will you please get that gun down
for me, Mrs. Bimby?”
</p>
<p>
She looked at Bert and smiled.
</p>
<p>
“You’re pretty small to handle a gun,” she
said. “But maybe you could fire it if I showed
you how. I’ve shot it more ’n once, and I
brought down a cawing crow last winter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
Sometimes the rabbits come close up to our
cabin here. Wait till I take a look.”
</p>
<p>
She went to the window to peer out into the
storm, and Nan did likewise, while Bert continued
to gaze at the gun on the wall. It was
a shotgun, not very heavy, and he felt certain
he could aim it at a rabbit and pull the trigger.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bimby shook her head as she turned
away from her window.
</p>
<p>
“There’s no game here,” she said. “Guess
we’ll have to go without a potpie.”
</p>
<p>
But Nan suddenly uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I see one!” she cried. “I see a big
rabbit! Two of ’em! Oh, Bert, it’s a shame
to shoot the bunnies, but we can’t starve! Get
the gun!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—BERT STARTS OUT</h2>
<p>
Just about the time that Bert was getting
ready to try for a rabbit potpie by firing the
gun from the door of Mrs. Bimby’s cabin, in
the other and larger cabin at Cedar Camp the
smaller Bobbsey twins were having a good
time. There was no danger there of starving,
for the cupboard was far from being bare.
</p>
<p>
But of course Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey were
worried because, after their long night of
worry, neither Bert nor Nan had come back,
and there was no news of them.
</p>
<p>
“But we’ll surely hear from them to-day,”
said Tom Case, as he came over through the
storm after breakfast to learn if Mr. Bobbsey
had any special plans.
</p>
<p>
“How’s Old Jim?” asked Mr. Bobbsey, as
the head of the sawmill workers came in out
of the storm, for it was still snowing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Jim’s all right,” was the answer. “But
he’s worrying about his wife not having any
food. I came over to say that if the storm lets
up a little maybe we’d better try to take something
to eat to the old lady. She’s all alone in
her cabin.”
</p>
<p>
Of course neither he nor Old Jim knew
that the two older Bobbsey twins were at that
very moment with Mrs. Bimby.
</p>
<p>
“All right, it would be a good idea,” said
Mr. Bobbsey. “And we must make another
search for Bert and Nan.”
</p>
<p>
“I have a sort of feeling that they’re safe,”
said Mr. Case. “And, really, it wouldn’t be
wise for you to start out in this storm to look
for them. I think it may moderate a little by
to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us hope so!” sighed Mrs. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t Old Jim come over and play with
us?” asked Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“We want to have some fun,” added
Freddie.
</p>
<p>
The two smaller twins had been as good as
possible, but they were not used to being cooped
up in the house, and there really was not much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
to do in the cabin. No toys had been brought
along, for Mr. Bobbsey had not expected to
stay very long in looking after his Christmas
trees. And he certainly never counted on being
snowed in.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’ll bring Old Jim over,” said Mr.
Case. “He’s pretty good at making things
with his pocket knife. Shouldn’t wonder but
what he could cut you out a doll, Flossie.”
</p>
<p>
“Can he make boats?” asked Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Sure he can!” said the sawmill foreman.
</p>
<p>
“Where you going to sail a boat in the snow,
Freddie Bobbsey?” asked Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“I—I’ll have him make me a snow-boat!”
the little fellow said.
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” laughed Flossie. “There are ice-boats,
’cause we rode in one once, but there
aren’t any snow-boats, are there, Daddy?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, perhaps Old Jim can make one,” her
father said. “Bring him over, Tom. I want
to talk to him and find out where would be the
most likely place for Nan and Bert to have
found shelter.”
</p>
<p>
The old logger, who seemed to have gotten
over his exposure to the storm, came to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
Bobbsey cabin, and he somewhat relieved the
worries of Bert’s father and mother by saying
there were a number of cabins of loggers and
trappers scattered through the woods, and he
had an idea that Bert and his sister might have
reached one of these.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll start out and look for them as
soon as the storm lets up a little,” said Mr.
Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
Freddie and Flossie made great friends with
Old Jim. They took to him at once, and when
he cut out of a piece of wood a queer doll for
Flossie, and made for Freddie a thin wooden
wheel, which would turn around in the waves
of heat arising from the hot stove, the children
were delighted.
</p>
<p>
They climbed all over Old Jim, and laughed
and shouted as though they had no cares in the
world. And, as a matter of fact, they were not
old enough to worry about Bert and Nan.
They thought their older brother and sister
would come along sooner or later.
</p>
<p>
Slowly the day of storm passed, but with
no let-up in the falling snow. The wind, while
it did not blow as violently as at first, was high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
and cold, so that the little Bobbsey twins could
not go out.
</p>
<p>
And it was about the time that Flossie
and Freddie were having such fun with Old
Jim that, back in this same logger’s lonely
cabin, Bert and Nan were wondering whether
they would have anything to eat for supper.
</p>
<p>
As Nan had said, she did see two large rabbits
when she looked from the window. And
she called to her brother to get the gun from its
place over the mantel.
</p>
<p>
“Land sakes!” exclaimed Mrs. Bimby,
“there <em>are</em> two right in plain sight. Now Bert,
if you’re any kind of a shot, maybe we’ll have
rabbit stew for supper. Here, take the gun,
but be careful!”
</p>
<p>
Bert knew a little about firearms, and he was
not at all afraid as Mrs. Bimby put the shotgun
into his hands. Then she opened the door for
him, very carefully, so as not to frighten the
rabbits.
</p>
<p>
“They’re still there, right on top of the
snow!” called Nan, as she peered from the
window on her side of the cabin. “I’m not
going to watch you shoot them, Bert, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
I am terribly hungry. And I’m going to hold
my hands over my ears so I won’t hear the
gun.”
</p>
<p>
Bert was quite excited, and did not pay much
attention to what his sister was saying, but
he was not so excited that he could not hold
the gun fairly steady.
</p>
<p>
“Hold it close against your shoulder, then
it won’t kick so hard,” Mrs. Bimby whispered
in his ear, as she helped him get the shotgun
in place, and pointed it for him out of the
open door.
</p>
<p>
The rabbits were in plain sight now, two
wild, gray bunnies, fat and plump. Bert took
sight over the little point on the end of the
gun. He held this sight as steadily as he
could in line with one of the rabbits.
</p>
<p>
“Better shoot quick!” whispered Mrs. Bimby.
“I think they see us and they’ll scoot away
in a minute!”
</p>
<p>
Bert gave a steady pull on the trigger, not a
sudden pull, which is not the right way to
shoot. A sudden pull spoils your aim.
</p>
<p>
“Bang!” went the shotgun.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” screamed Nan, who, in spite of having held her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
hands over her ears, heard the report.
</p>
<p>
“I got one! I got one!” excitedly cried
Bert, as he saw one of the bunnies lying on
the snow. The other had scampered off.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you did get one, child!” said Mrs.
Bimby, as she ran out into the storm and came
back with the game. “Now we shan’t starve.
I’ll make a potpie.”
</p>
<p>
This she did, stewing the rabbit with some
dumplings she made from a little flour she had
left in the bottom of the barrel. Bert and Nan
thought nothing had ever tasted so good as that
rabbit potpie.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll be quite a hunter when you grow
up,” said Mrs. Bimby, when the meal was over.
“You shot straight and true, Bert!”
</p>
<p>
“But you helped me,” said the Bobbsey boy.
“I couldn’t have aimed the gun straight if you
hadn’t helped me.”
</p>
<p>
“But I saw the rabbits, didn’t I?” asked
Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dearie, you surely did,” said the kind
old woman. “Now we shan’t starve for a
couple of days, anyhow.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
“And then I can shoot more rabbits, or maybe
some squirrels,” Bert declared.
</p>
<p>
“I hope by that time the storm’ll be over,”
remarked Mrs. Bimby, “and that my Jim will
come back.”
</p>
<p>
“Will he take us home, or bring our father
here?” Nan questioned.
</p>
<p>
“I guess so,” Mrs. Bimby answered.
</p>
<p>
But as the snow kept up all the remainder
of that day, and as it was still storming hard
when night came, there did not seem much
chance of the two older Bobbsey twins being
rescued.
</p>
<p>
Again Bert and Nan spent the night in the
little rooms of the cabin, but they slept better
this time, Nan not even awakening for a drink
of water. And in the morning Bert looked
from a window and cried:
</p>
<p>
“Hurray! The snow’s stopping! I’m going
to start out and go back to camp!”
</p>
<p>
“You are?” asked Nan. “Are you going to
take me?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Bert. “You’d better stay here.
I’ll go to camp and send daddy back in a sled
for you. He can hitch a horse to one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
lumber sleds now that the snow is stopping,
and he can ride you home. And if I find your
husband I’ll send him back with a lot of things
to eat,” he told Mrs. Bimby.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you would, dearie,” said the old
woman. “But are you really going to start
out, Bert?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m! My father and mother will be
worried about us. I can get to camp now, I’m
sure, as the storm is almost over.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bimby, who, though not very wise,
was kind, made him take a little lunch with
him, packing up some cold boiled chestnuts
and part of the cold rabbit meat. It was all
there was.
</p>
<p>
“But maybe I’ll get to camp before I have
to eat,” said Bert. “And I’ll send back help
to you.”
</p>
<p>
So Bert started out, Mrs. Bimby showing him
the direction he was to take. It was still
snowing a little, but he hoped it would soon
stop.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—TRYING AGAIN</h2>
<p>
Though Flossie and Freddie had what they
called “good times” in the log cabin at Cedar
Camp, and though Old Jim played with them,
making boats and dolls of wood, still the small
Bobbsey twins wished for the time to come
when they might go out of doors. They also
began to wish for the return of Bert and Nan.
</p>
<p>
“When <em>will</em> they come, Mother?” Flossie
asked over and over again.
</p>
<p>
“And bring us chestnuts!” teased Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they’ll come soon now,” Mrs. Bobbsey
said, as she looked out of the window at the
flakes of snow, still falling, and listened to the
whistle of the cold wind around the cabin.
</p>
<p>
And in her heart how very much Mrs. Bobbsey
wished that Bert and Nan would come back
soon! Mr. Bobbsey wished the same thing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
and the only comfort the father and mother
had in those worrisome days was the thought
that their older twins <em>must</em> have found shelter
somewhere in the woods.
</p>
<p>
Old Jim declared that this was so, as, likewise,
did Tom Case and Jim Denton. But
it was still storming too much for another
searching party to set out and look for Nan
and Bert. Those who searched might themselves
become lost in the blizzard. For that
is what the storm now was—a regular blizzard.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bobbsey could do nothing toward
searching for the lost shipment of Christmas
trees. The lumbermen could not work at cutting
down trees, floating or sledding them to
the mill or carting them to the railroad. Even
the sawmill was shut down, and all there was
to do was to wait.
</p>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie were not used to staying
in the house so long at a time. They wanted to
go out and play even if there was snow, but
their mother would not let them in such an
unusual storm.
</p>
<p>
“It’s like when we were at Snow Lodge,”
sighed Flossie, as she stood with her little nose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
pressed flat against the window, thereby making
her face cold.
</p>
<p>
“We could go out a little there,” sighed
Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“I think you children are very lucky,” said
their mother. “You have a warm place to
stay. Think of poor Nan and Bert. They
may——”
</p>
<p>
She stopped suddenly. She dared not think
of what her older son and daughter might be
suffering. She glanced quickly at Flossie and
Freddie. She was afraid lest she should make
them worry, too.
</p>
<p>
But, fortunately, Flossie and Freddie were
not that sort. They did not believe in worrying,
unless it was over not having fun enough.
However, the log cabin was of good size, and
with Old Jim to come over now and then to
amuse them with cutting out wooden toys, the
two Bobbsey twins did not have such a sad
time as might be imagined.
</p>
<p>
To-day, however, when the storm had kept
up so long, and when they had not had a chance
to go out, they felt rather lonesome and as
if they wanted to “do something.” So, presently, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
Flossie had grown tired of pressing
her nose against the glass, making it cold, and
then holding it on Freddie’s cheek to hear him
exclaim in surprise, the little girl wandered
about looking for something to do. Freddie
joined her, and while their mother was in another
room, talking to Mr. Bobbsey, and saying
he ought, soon, to make another trip and search
for Bert and Nan, Flossie and Freddie went
up in the top story of the log cabin.
</p>
<p>
The log cabin was the largest in that part
of the woods, and was higher than most, so
that in addition to the bedrooms on the second
floor, there was, above them, an open attic,
reached by a short flight of steps, and in it
were stored all sorts of odds and ends.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we can find something here to play
with,” suggested Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe,” agreed Freddie.
</p>
<p>
They rummaged around in the half-dark
place, back in corners where the roof came
down slanting and making little “cubby-holes,”
and it was after a glance into one of these
places that Flossie drew back and whispered
to Freddie:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
“There’s a bear in here!”
</p>
<p>
“A bear! Where?” and Freddie moved
over closer to Flossie and looked where she
pointed.
</p>
<p>
“There,” said the little girl, and, glancing
along the line of her outstretched finger, Freddie
saw a big, furry heap in a dark corner.
“I touched it first with my foot,” said Flossie,
“and it was soft, just like the bear I touched
that the Italian had once, leading around by a
string in his nose. And then I put out my
hand and I felt his fur!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Freddie. “Did he—did
he bite you?” He had been looking for something
to play with on the other side of the
attic, and, therefore, had not seen all that Flossie
had.
</p>
<p>
“Course he didn’t bite me!” the little girl
answered. “You didn’t hear me holler, did
you?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Freddie, “I didn’t. I’m going to
touch him!”
</p>
<p>
“Come over here,” advised Flossie, moving
to one side so Freddie could thrust his hand
forward and touch that mysterious heap of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
fur. “I—I guess maybe he’s asleep, that’s why
he didn’t growl or nothin’!”
</p>
<p>
“I guess maybe,” agreed Freddie. Neither
of the Bobbsey twins felt surprised because
they had an idea a bear might be in the attic
with them. Nor were they afraid. A sleeping
bear is not dangerous, of course. Any little
boy or girl knows that!
</p>
<p>
Freddie crawled a little way farther under
the sloping roof and, by stretching out his hand,
managed to touch the fur. It felt warm and
soft to his fingers.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it <em>is</em> a bear!” he whispered, and he was
delighted. “Let’s go and tell mother, and we
can bring it downstairs and play with it. I
guess it’s a little bear!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we’d better tell mother,” agreed
Flossie. Somehow, the more she thought of
a bear being up in the attic the more she thought
it better to have some of the older folks know
about it.
</p>
<p>
Down the stairs went the two Bobbsey twins,
walking softly so as not to awaken the bear.
They didn’t want him suddenly aroused from
his sleep and made cross. Who would?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where have you children been?” cried Mrs.
Bobbsey, as she saw the two twins. They
were covered with dust and cobwebs from having
crawled so far under the sloping roof in
the attic. The floor was dirty, too, not having
been swept in many months, and they had sat
right down in the worst of the dust.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mother!” gasped Flossie, “we’ve been
up in the attic, and what do you think’s up
there? It’s a——”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Bear!</em>” burst out Freddie, not wanting his
sister to tell all the wonderful news. “He’s
asleep, an’ I touched him!”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey. “A
bear? It can’t be!”
</p>
<p>
And yet she knew there were bears in the
North Woods, and it might be possible that
one had crawled into the cabin before they
had come, and had gone to the attic to have his
long winter sleep.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is a bear!” insisted Flossie, and
both children were so certain about the heap
of fur that Mrs. Bobbsey called her husband,
who was out in the woodshed with Tom Case
and Jim Bimby.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“A bear!” cried the mill foreman. “Well,
there are some around these woods, but I never
knew of one coming into a cabin. I’ll take a
look.”
</p>
<p>
“Hadn’t you better take a gun?” asked Mr.
Bobbsey, as he and Old Jim followed the foreman
upstairs. “There’s one here.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you might hand it to me,” said Mr.
Case. “But I reckon if it is a bear that’s
crawled in to go to sleep, he’ll be so lazy I
can take him by the back of the neck and throw
him out.”
</p>
<p>
Freddie and Flossie waited with their mother
while their father and the two men went to
the attic. They could hear the three moving
around up overhead, and soon there was a
shout of laughter.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s a circus bear, and he’s doing
tricks!” exclaimed Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I hope it is!” added Freddie, feeling
quite excited.
</p>
<p>
Their father and the two men came downstairs.
Tom Case carried something—something
brown and shaggy, just like the fur of
some animal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
“There’s your ‘bear!’” he said, laughing, as
he tossed the furry object over a chair. “A
bear skin! Ha! Ha!”
</p>
<p>
And that is what it was. The skin of a
big bear, made into a lap robe for use in cold
weather. The fur was warm, thick and soft,
and when the skin was huddled up in a heap in
a corner no wonder the Bobbsey twins mistook
it for a real bear, especially in the dark.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a good warm fur robe,” said Old
Jim. “If it was made into a fur coat it would
keep out the cold.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe that’s what the man who used to
live here was going to use it for,” said Mr.
Bobbsey. “He moved away and forgot it.
Well, you children can play with it,” he said
to Flossie and Freddie. “It was a bear once.”
</p>
<p>
And the Bobbsey twins had fun taking turns
wrapping the bear skin about them and pretending
to be different kinds of wild animals.
</p>
<p>
It was when the storm began to grow less
severe, the wind not blowing so hard and the
snow not coming down so thickly, that Mr.
Bobbsey, looking from the window when
Flossie and Freddie were playing “bear,” said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think I’ll start out again.”
</p>
<p>
“Where?” asked his wife.
</p>
<p>
“To find Bert and Nan,” he answered. “I
think the blizzard is about over, and they will
probably be starting for home. I’ll go to meet
them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, take us!” cried Flossie and Freddie.
“We want to see Bert and Nan.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, I couldn’t take you,” said their
father. “The snow is piled deep in drifts, and
you’d sink away down in—over your heads.
I’ll take some of the men and start,” he said to
his wife.
</p>
<p>
And so, a little later, another searching party
started away from Cedar Camp to find the
missing Bobbsey twins.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go along,” said Old Jim, who was now
able to travel. “I must take some food to my
wife. She’ll be ’most starved.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, come with us,” said Mr. Bobbsey.
“We’ll take some food to Mrs. Bimby.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—A LITTLE SEARCHING PARTY</h2>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie Bobbsey were two of
the kindest children in the world. They were
fond of fun and of having a good time, but
whenever their mother did work for the church
at home, helping poor families, taking food to
people who had but little, Freddie and Flossie
always wanted to do their share. So did Bert
and Nan; but as the older twins had to spend
more time in school than did Flossie and Freddie,
the two latter had more chances to help
their mother.
</p>
<p>
More than once they had gone with her
when she carried a basket of food or a bundle
of clothing to some poor family in Lakeport.
And now, in Cedar Camp, having heard their
father say he was going to take food to Mrs.
Bimby, Flossie and Freddie at once had an
idea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
While Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey were out of
the room, talking over the coming trip through
the woods to look for Bert and Nan, as well
as to take food to Mrs. Bimby, Freddie said
to Flossie:
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go, too!”
</p>
<p>
“Daddy won’t let us,” Flossie answered.
</p>
<p>
“We—we’ll tag after him,” said Freddie
in a whisper. “We can put on our rubber boots
and our coats and mittens, and we can go behind
him. He can’t hear us, ’cause there’s so
much snow our boots won’t make any noise.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” agreed Flossie. “And, oh,
Freddie! I know what we can do.”
</p>
<p>
“What?”
</p>
<p>
“We can take Mrs. Bimby that bear robe.
It’ll keep her warm, ’cause it’s so nice and
soft!”
</p>
<p>
“So ’tis!” agreed Freddie. “We’ll take it,
and something to eat, too.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll not have to do that, Daddy and the
other men are going to take her something to
eat.”
</p>
<p>
“I meant something to eat for us,” Freddie
said. “We ought to take a lunch with us,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
’cause maybe we’ll get hungry in the woods.”
</p>
<p>
The younger Bobbsey twins had a feeling
that if they were seen packing up a lunch for
themselves, putting on their boots and outdoor
garments, and taking the bear skin, they
would be stopped. They felt sure they would
not be allowed to go in search of Nan and
Bert. And they were probably right.
</p>
<p>
So, as they had done more than once before,
they said nothing of their plans, but went
about them secretly and quietly. While their
mother and Mrs. Baxter were packing two
large baskets with food for Old Jim’s wife,
and while Daddy Bobbsey was talking to the
men about the coming trip through the snow-filled
woods, Flossie and Freddie took their
boots, coats, caps and mittens to the back door
of the log cabin.
</p>
<p>
“We can slip out and put ’em on there when
nobody is looking,” said Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to take the bear skin out, too,”
Flossie remarked.
</p>
<p>
But when they tried to bundle the skin of
the bear up so they could carry it, they found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
it so heavy and slippery to lift that they had
to give it up.
</p>
<p>
“What’ll we do?” asked Flossie, as, after
several trials she had to admit that the skin
could not be carried. “Mrs. Bimby’ll be so
disappointed!”
</p>
<p>
“We can tell her it’s here, and Mr. Jim can
come and get it,” suggested Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’ll be nice!” his sister agreed.
“We’ll leave the skin.”
</p>
<p>
How to pack up a lunch for themselves was
also a hard matter. But, as it happened, Mrs.
Bobbsey was so busy getting things ready for
her husband and the other men that she did not
pay much attention to what Flossie and Freddie
did. She saw them moving about, now in the
pantry and now in the kitchen and again stepping
to the back door, but she did not dream
they were getting ready to set off on a search
by themselves.
</p>
<p>
However, this is just what Flossie and
Freddie were going to do, and, after a while,
they managed to pack into a pasteboard box
what they thought would be lunch enough for
them until they came back with Bert and Nan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
“Put in lots of cake,” whispered Freddie
to Flossie, on one of the little girl’s trips to
the pantry. “Cake tastes awful good in the
woods.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” Flossie whispered back. “And I
got some pie, too!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s fine!” Freddie exclaimed. “Now
we must slip out when they don’t see us.”
</p>
<p>
This the small Bobbsey twins managed to
do. While Mr. Bobbsey, with Old Jim and
Tom Case, was making ready to start on his
searching expedition, to find and bring back
Bert and Nan, as well as to take food to lonely
Mrs. Bimby, Flossie and Freddie slipped
quietly to the back door with their queer package
of lunch.
</p>
<p>
They soon donned their boots, coats and
caps, and with their little hands covered with
warm, red mittens, they started off, keeping
behind the cabin so they would not be seen by
those in front who were getting ready to start
on the main searching trip. It was snowing
a little, but not nearly so hard as at first, and
the wind was not so strong or cold.
</p>
<p>
“It’ll be fun!” said Flossie to Freddie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
“Lots of fun!” agreed her twin. “We’ll
wait until daddy and Mr. Jim and Mr. Case
get in the woods, and then we’ll follow ’em.
They won’t send us back!”
</p>
<p>
“No,” agreed Flossie, “I don’t guess they
will.”
</p>
<p>
The plan of the little Bobbsey twins was to
follow their father on the search. They did
not want to go through the woods alone, even
though it was now daylight, though the sun
did not shine because of the snow clouds.
</p>
<p>
And so, a little while after Mr. Bobbsey and
the two men started away from the log cabin,
Flossie and Freddie set out on their own little
searching party. Mrs. Bobbsey and Mrs. Baxter
were so busy “cleaning up” after the men
left that they gave no thought to the children
for a time.
</p>
<p>
“There they go!” whispered Flossie to
Freddie, as, hiding behind a woodpile, they
saw their father, Mr. Bimby and Tom Case
start off.
</p>
<p>
“Wait a little, and then we’ll go after ’em,”
advised Freddie.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the main party had marched off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
along the trail that led through the woods toward
the chestnut grove that Bert and Nan had
set out to visit two days before, the small
Bobbsey twins set forth. They went around
behind a clump of trees so they would not be
seen from the cabin.
</p>
<p>
Flossie and Freddie expected soon to catch
up to their father, but the snow was so deep
and the men traveled so fast that, after trudging
along for half an hour, Freddie and his
sister had not yet come within sight of the
others.
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose they ran away from us?”
asked Flossie, as she stopped a moment to rest.
</p>
<p>
“Course not,” answered Freddie. “They
don’t even know we’re comin’ after ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” Flossie said. “Well, anyhow,
I hope we don’t get lost.”
</p>
<p>
“I do, too,” agreed Freddie. “But we have
something to eat, anyhow,” and he patted
the box of lunch he carried.
</p>
<p>
The children looked around them. They
were in a lonely part of the woods, a place
they had never been before, but they felt sure
they would soon catch up to their father. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
had been following the tracks in the snow
left by the men who had gone to find Bert
and Nan and take food to Mrs. Bimby.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, however, there came a harder
flurry of snow, and for a time Flossie and
Freddie could not see very well. And when
the little squall, as sudden storms are called,
had passed, the two Bobbsey twins found they
had wandered off to one side of the trail.
</p>
<p>
No longer could they see the footprints of
their father and the others in the snow. They
had nothing to guide them!
</p>
<p>
“Freddie! Look!” cried Flossie, “Where’s
the path?” She called her father’s snow-track
a “path.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, it—it’s gone!” Freddie had to admit.
</p>
<p>
And then, as the two little children stood in
the lonely snow-filled woods, they heard, near
a bush, a noise that made them suddenly afraid.
</p>
<p>
It was a growl that they heard!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—THE WILDCAT</h2>
<p>
Bert Bobbsey started off bravely enough
from the cabin of Mrs. Bimby to go for help
for the old woman, so that food might be
taken to her bare cupboard.
</p>
<p>
“And I’ll have daddy bring a sled or something
so Nan can ride home to camp on it,”
thought Bert, as he trudged along through the
snow. “It’s hard walking. I wish I had a pair
of snowshoes.”
</p>
<p>
He had started away from the lonely cabin,
as I told you two chapters back. With him
he took a little package of lunch, not very
much, for he felt sure he would soon reach
Cedar Camp by following the line of the brook,
nor was there much to be got from Mrs. Bimby’s
bare cupboard. Even though much snow
had fallen, Bert hoped the bed of the brook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
could be made out once he came to it. It lay
some distance from the cabin, he thought.
</p>
<p>
The Bobbsey twin boy turned, after trudging
a little way from the cabin, and waved
his hand at Mrs. Bimby and Nan, who stood
near a window watching him.
</p>
<p>
“Your brother is a brave little chap,” said
Mrs. Bimby. “I do hope he finds help and
brings it back to us.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so, too; ’specially something for you
to eat,” said Nan.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, we’ve a little of the rabbit left
yet,” said the old woman. “But my tea is ’most
gone, and I need it strong on account of my
nerves. If it wasn’t for my rheumatiz I’d put
on my things and go with Bert. I’d take you
along, though I fear it’s going to snow more.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope it doesn’t before Bert gets back to
camp,” Nan said. “I shouldn’t want him lost
all alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I, dearie,” crooned Mrs. Bimby. “But
he’s a brave lad, and I trust he gets along all
right. Though it has been a bad storm—a bad
storm!” she muttered.
</p>
<p>
She put more wood on the fire, for, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
the wind had gone down a little and the snow
was not falling so rapidly, it was still cold.
But the blazing wood threw out a grateful
heat, and Nan and Mrs. Bimby sat about the
stove, waiting for the help Bert was to send.
</p>
<p>
Bert felt a little lonely as he plunged into
the woods and lost sight of the cabin. Though
it was daylight, and the woods were not dark
because of the white snow, still Bert felt a
little lonesome. He wished Nan had come
with him.
</p>
<p>
“But I guess a girl couldn’t get along,” he
said to himself, as he plunged through drift
after drift. Indeed it was hard work for Bert,
sturdy as he was, to wade along, especially as
he had on no boots, not having expected a
storm when he and Nan started after chestnuts.
</p>
<p>
“Now let me see,” said Bert Bobbsey, talking
to himself half aloud, to make his trip seem
less lonesome. “The first thing I want to do
is to find the brook. I can follow that back
to camp, I’m pretty sure. But it’s a good way
from here, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
He remembered having seen the brook just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
before he and Nan reached the first chestnut
grove, where they found the squirrels and
chipmunks had taken most of the supply, making
the children go farther on. And then the
Bobbsey twins had rather lost sight of the
stream of water.
</p>
<p>
Bert knew it might be almost hidden from
sight under overhanging banks of snow, but
he knew if he could come upon the water course
it would be the surest thing to follow to get
back to camp. So as he trudged along, into
and out of drifts, he looked eagerly about for
a sign of the brook, which, as it went on,
widened and ran into the mill pond near Cedar
Camp.
</p>
<p>
Bert was all by himself in the snowy woods.
The cabin, where his sister and Mrs. Bimby
waited for him to bring help, was lost to sight
amid the trees. For the first time since leaving
Cedar Camp Bert began to feel lonesome and
afraid.
</p>
<p>
It was so still and quiet in the woods! Not
a sound! No birds fluttered through the trees
or called aloud. The birds that had not flown
south were, doubtless, keeping under shelter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
until they dared venture out to look for food,
which some of them would never find.
</p>
<p>
“There isn’t even a crow!” said Bert aloud,
and his voice, in that white stillness, almost
startled him by its loudness.
</p>
<p>
He reached the top of a little hill, where
there was not quite so much snow, the wind
having blown it off, and there Bert stopped
for a moment, looking about. It was a lonesome
and dreary scene that lay before him.
Not a house in sight, only a stretch of snow
and trees, and the wind howled mournfully
through the bare, leafless branches.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there’s no use standing here,” murmured
Bert to himself. “I’ve got to travel on
and bring help to Nan and the old lady. I’m
glad Nan has some shelter, anyhow. And I
s’pose mother will be worrying about us. But
we couldn’t help it. Nobody would guess a
storm would come up so quickly.”
</p>
<p>
Throwing back his shoulders as he had seen
men do when they had some hard task before
them, Bert started off again. Through the
snow he trudged, tossing the white flakes aside
with his small but sturdy legs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
All at once, on the white expanse in front
of him, Bert saw a movement. At first he
thought it was just some loose snow, blown
about by the wind, which came in fitful gusts.
But as he looked a second time he saw that it
was not the wind.
</p>
<p>
“It’s some animal!” exclaimed the boy,
speaking aloud, for he wanted company, and,
like the men of the desert or wilderness, he
fell naturally into the habit of talking to himself.
“It’s some animal.”
</p>
<p>
Having said this Bert came to a stop, for
he knew there might be many sorts of animals
in the woods.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what it is,” he whispered. Somehow
or other a whisper seemed more the sort
of voice to use in that lonesome place.
</p>
<p>
A moment later he saw a patch of brown,
and then two big ears appeared to be thrust
out of a hole in the snow.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a rabbit—a bunny!” cried Bert, and
he did not whisper this time.
</p>
<p>
As he shouted Bert sprang forward through
the snow and toward the brown rabbit that had
so unexpectedly appeared. Whether it was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
boy’s shout or his quick movement, or both,
was not certain, but the rabbit was frightened
and dashed away over the snow, sometimes
sinking down almost out of sight, and again,
by some means, keeping on the surface of the
snow, which was packed harder in some places
than in others.
</p>
<p>
“If I can only get you!” gasped Bert, for
his speed through the snow was making him
pant and his breath come short. “I’ll get you
and take you back to Nan and Mrs. Bimby!
They won’t have enough to eat unless I do,
maybe, for it may take me a long while to get
back to camp.”
</p>
<p>
Bert had no weapon—he could not even pick
up a stone, for they were all covered from
sight by the mass of white. But the boy had
an idea that he could catch the rabbit alive.
</p>
<p>
Bert was not a cruel boy, and under other
circumstances he never would have dreamed
of trying to hurt or catch a bunny. But now
he felt that the lives of his sister and Mrs.
Bimby might depend on this game.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get you! I’ll run you down!” muttered
Bert.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
Now a rabbit is a very fast-moving animal.
Out West there is a kind called jackrabbits,
and they can go faster than the average dog.
Only a greyhound or other long-legged dog
can beat a jackrabbit running. But though
this bunny was not a jackrabbit, being the common
wild rabbit of the woods and fields, still
it could go faster than could Bert—and in the
snow at that.
</p>
<p>
Every now and again Bert would get so near
the bunny that he felt sure that the next moment
he would be able to get hold of the long
ears. But every time the rabbit would give a
desperate jump and get beyond the boy’s reach.
</p>
<p>
“Whew!” exclaimed Bert, as he was forced
to stop, because his legs were so tired and
because his breath was so short. “I don’t wonder
hunters have to use guns! They never
could get much game just by chasing after it.
It wouldn’t be any use to set a trap, for I
haven’t time and I haven’t anything to bait it
with. Besides, I guess you’re so smart you’d
never be caught in it.”
</p>
<p>
As Bert came to a stop on top of another
little hill where the snow was partly blown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
away, the rabbit also halted. It looked back at
the boy. Probably the bunny was as tired as
was Bert.
</p>
<p>
“If I only had something to throw at you!”
murmured the boy. “I can’t find any stones,
but I can take a stick.”
</p>
<p>
There were trees near at hand, and from
the low branches of one of these Bert broke
off a number of pieces of dead wood. They
cracked like pistol shots, and, turning around
to look at the rabbit, Bert saw it scooting away
over the snow. Probably the little furry
creature thought some hunter was shooting at
it.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess I’ll have to give up,” said
the boy, half aloud. “I’ll only get lost chasing
after you. As it is, I guess I’ve come ’most a
mile out of my way.”
</p>
<p>
He threw the sticks he had broken off, but
he did not come anywhere near hitting the
brown bunny.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, you’re safe! I won’t chase you
any farther,” said Bert. “And I wouldn’t have
chased you now, and scared you ’most to death,
if the folks back in the shack weren’t so low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
on food. Maybe I can find something else.”
</p>
<p>
Bert floundered about in the snow, following
his tracks back before they should be filled
and so hidden from sight. He was about half
way to the place where he had surprised the
rabbit when he heard a chattering in a tree
over his head.
</p>
<p>
“A squirrel!” exclaimed the boy. “And a
grey one, too, or I miss my guess.”
</p>
<p>
He kept very still, listening. Again, above
the noise of the storm was heard the sharp,
squealing chatter of a squirrel, and, looking
up over his head, Bert saw the animal. It
was a large, grey squirrel, with a tail almost
as big as its whole body.
</p>
<p>
The squirrel sat up on a limb and looked
down at the boy. It may have been angry or
frightened, and it seemed to be scolding Bert
as it chattered at him. Grey squirrels are not
such excited scolders as the little red chaps
are, but this one did very well.
</p>
<p>
“If you know what’s good for you, you’ll
go back into your nest and stay there,” Bert
said. “I can’t get you, and you ought to know
it, for I haven’t a gun and I never could throw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
up a stick and knock you down. You’d be
good eating if I could,” Bert went on, for he
had often heard his father tell of broiled
squirrels.
</p>
<p>
Bert could see a hole in the tree half way
up the trunk, and he guessed that here the
squirrel had his winter nest. It would be well
lined with dried leaves, soft grass, and perhaps
some cotton from the milkweed pods. Thus
the squirrels keep warm, wrapping their big
bushy tails about them.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess I’ll say good-bye to you,”
went on Bert, as he turned aside from the squirrel
in the tree and resumed his trudging
through the snow. The weather was cold, and
Bert was cold likewise. Also he was tired.
His legs ached and his shoulders pained him,
for walking through the snow is not easy
work, as you who have tried it know.
</p>
<p>
However, he knew that he must keep bravely
on, and so, after turning once or twice, making
sure he could not see the cabin, he went along
faster.
</p>
<p>
It was because of his speed that an accident
happened to Bert which might have been a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
serious one. He was traveling with his head
held down, to keep the falling snow out of his
face, when he suddenly felt himself falling.
</p>
<p>
Down, down he went, as though he had
stepped into some big hole, or off some high
cliff. He gave a cry of alarm, and threw out
both hands to grasp something to save himself,
but there was nothing to grasp. Down, down
went poor Bert!
</p>
<p>
It was a good thing there was so much snow
on the ground. The piles and drifts of white
flakes were like so many heaps of feathers, and
Bert was thankful when at last, after sliding,
slipping, falling and tumbling, he came to a
stop, half buried in a deep drift. He was
somewhat shaken up, and he had dropped his
package of lunch, but at first he did not think
he was much hurt until he tried to move his
left leg.
</p>
<p>
Then such a pain shot through the boy that
he had to cry aloud. He shut his eyes and
leaned back against the pile of snow into which
he had fallen. The first flash of pain passed,
and he began to feel a little better. But a terrible
thought came to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“What if my leg is broken?” said Bert, half
aloud. “I can’t walk, I can’t go for help, and
I’ll have to stay here. Daddy or nobody will
know where to find me—not even Nan or Mrs.
Bimby! Oh, this is terrible!”
</p>
<p>
But he knew he must be brave, for he had
to help not only himself but his sister and the
old woman in the cabin. Clenching his teeth
to keep back the cry of pain which he felt
would come when he moved his leg again, Bert
shifted it a little to one side. The spasm of
pain came, but not so bad as at first.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s only broken a little,” thought
the boy. “And I can crawl, if I can’t walk.”
He had read of hunters and trappers who, with
a broken or badly cut leg, had crawled miles
over the snow to get help. Bert wanted to be
as brave as these heroes.
</p>
<p>
But when he moved his leg for the third
time and found the pain not quite so bad, he
began to take heart. He brushed away the
snow from both legs and looked at them. They
appeared to be all right, but the left one felt
a little queer. And it was not until he had
managed to pull himself up, by means of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
stunted bush showing through the snow, that
Bert knew his leg was not broken.
</p>
<p>
It was strained a little, and it hurt some
when he bore his weight on it, but he found
that he could at least walk, if he could not run,
and he was thankful for this. He looked up
toward the place from where he had fallen,
and saw that, without knowing it, he had
stepped over the edge of a steep hill. The
snow had hidden the edge from Bert, and he
had plunged right over it.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s my lunch?” he asked aloud, and
then he saw the package, which had fallen to
one side of the place where he had plunged
into the drift. Bert picked it up, and then,
thankful that his accident was no worse, he
went on again.
</p>
<p>
“I guess maybe the brook is here,” he said,
for he noticed that he was down in a valley,
and he knew that water always sought low
levels. “I’ll walk along here,” said Bert.
</p>
<p>
He was so frightened, thinking of what
might have happened if he had been crippled
and unable to walk, that he did not feel hungry,
though it was some time since breakfast. On
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
he trudged through the snow, looking for signs
of the brook, which he hoped would lead him
to Cedar Camp.
</p>
<p>
It was while he was passing through a clump
of woods that Bert received another fright—one
that caused him to run on as fast as he
could, in spite of his aching leg.
</p>
<p>
He had gone half way through the clump
of trees, and he was wondering if he would
ever come to the brook, when suddenly he
heard a noise in a clump of bushes. The noise
sounded louder than usual, because it was all
so still and quiet near him.
</p>
<p>
Before Bert could guess what caused the
sound, he saw, pushing its way through the
underbrush, a tawny animal, with black spots
underneath and with little tufts of hair on its
ears. At once Bert knew what this was—a
wildcat, or lynx!
</p>
<p>
For a moment Bert was so frightened that
he just stood still, looking at the wildcat. And
then, as the animal gave a sort of snarl and
growl, the boy turned with a yell of fright
and ran off through the snow as fast as he
could go!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—SNOWBALL BULLETS</h2>
<p>
About the time that Bert Bobbsey was running
through the snow, to get away from the
wildcat, Flossie and Freddie were having a
scare of their own, some miles distant from
him, though in the same woods around Cedar
Camp.
</p>
<p>
The two smaller Bobbsey twins had gone off
without letting their father or mother know,
taking with them a lunch. They tramped
through the forest until they came to a lonely
place and had not yet caught sight of their
father, who had started off ahead with Old
Jim Bimby and Tom Case. Right here the
small twins heard a growl and saw a movement
in the bushes.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Flossie, shrinking
closer to Freddie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t know,” Freddie answered, trying
to think of something to make him brave.
“Maybe it’s a bear!”
</p>
<p>
“A bear?” questioned his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Yep!” Freddie went on, his eyes never moving
from the bush that seemed to hide some
animal. “Maybe it’s a bear like the one we
found the skin of in the attic.”
</p>
<p>
“It—it can’t be the <em>same one</em> coming back
for his skin, can it?” asked Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Course not!” declared Freddie. “How
could a bear go ’round without his skin on?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, a bear’s skin is just the same to him
as our clothes are to us,” Flossie went on.
“An’ sometimes, when we go swimming, we
don’t have very many clothes on.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, a bear is different,” said Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look!” suddenly cried the little girl,
and, pointing to the bush with one hand, she
clung to Freddie’s arm with the other. “He’s
coming out! He’s coming out!” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
A shaggy head could be seen thrusting itself
from the bushes, and the children were wondering
what sort of animal it could be, for it
did not look like a bear, when, with a joyful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
bark, there burst out in front of them—the
shaggy dog belonging to Tom Case!
</p>
<p>
Rover—Rover was the name of the dog—rushed
toward Flossie and Freddie, leaping
joyfully and wagging his tail. He had made
friends with the children as soon as they came
to Cedar Camp, and they loved Rover.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, hello!” cried Flossie, as if greeting an
old friend.
</p>
<p>
“He’s glad to see us and we’re glad to see
him,” said Freddie.
</p>
<p>
This seemed to be true, though I think
Flossie and Freddie were more pleased to see
Rover than he was to see them, for the dog
knew how to find his way home, and even trace
and find his master if need be, while, to tell
you the truth, Flossie and Freddie were lost,
though they did not yet know it. But they
were soon to find this out.
</p>
<p>
“Did you come looking for us?” asked Flossie,
as she patted the shaggy animal.
</p>
<p>
“I guess he did,” Freddie said. “I guess
he’d rather come with us than with daddy and
the others. Though we’ll take Rover to ’em,
won’t we?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Flossie. “But we must hurry
up and catch ’em, Freddie. We want to see
Mrs. Bimby and tell her about the nice warm
bear robe.”
</p>
<p>
“Sush! Don’t speak so loud,” cautioned
Freddie, looking over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” Flossie wanted to know.
</p>
<p>
“I mean about the bear robe,” her brother
went on. “There might be some bears in the
woods, and if they heard there was the skin of
one of ’em at the cabin, maybe they wouldn’t
like it.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe that’s so,” agreed Flossie, also looking
around. “But, anyhow, Rover’d drive the
bears away; wouldn’t you, Rover?”
</p>
<p>
The dog barked and wagged his tail, which
was the only answer he could give. It satisfied
the children, and soon they started off again,
making their way through the snow, hoping
they would soon catch up with their father,
Mr. Case and Mr. Bimby. Rover accompanied
Flossie and Freddie, sometimes ahead of them
and sometimes behind.
</p>
<p>
The dog had started out, as he often did,
to follow his master, but had lagged behind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
perhaps to run after a rabbit or squirrel. Then
he had come across the tracks of the children
and had gone to them, knowing they were
friends of his.
</p>
<p>
“I’m hungry,” said Flossie, after a while.
“Let’s sit under a Christmas tree and eat,
Freddie.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed her brother, always willing
to do this.
</p>
<p>
They were, just then, in a clump of evergreen
trees, and under some the snow was
not as deep as it was in the open. In fact the
children found one tree with no snow under
it at all, so thick were the branches, and so
close to the ground did they come. Crawling
into this little nest, where the ground was covered
with the dry needles from the pines and
other trees, Flossie and Freddie opened the
packages of lunch they had brought with
them.
</p>
<p>
Rover, smelling the food, crawled into the
shelter after them, and Flossie and Freddie
shared their lunch with the dog, who even ate
the crumbs off the ground.
</p>
<p>
“But we mustn’t eat everything,” said Freddie, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
part of the lunch had been disposed
of, Rover getting his share.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked Flossie. “Can’t you eat
all you want to when you’re hungry?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s best to save some,” Freddie answered.
“Maybe we’ll get stuck in the snow and can’t
get anything more to eat for a while, and then
we’ll be glad to have this.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” agreed Flossie, after thinking
it over. “I guess I’m not so very hungry. But
Rover is. He’s terrible hungry, Freddie. See
him look at the lunch.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed the dog seemed to be following, with
hungry eyes, every motion of the little boy who
was wrapping up again that part of the lunch
not eaten by him and his sister. They saved
about half of it.
</p>
<p>
Rover sniffed and snuffed as only a dog can,
but he made no effort to take the lunch that
Freddie placed in a crotch of the evergreen
tree which made such a nice shelter for him
and his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you take it, Rover!” cautioned
Flossie, shaking her finger at him.
</p>
<p>
Rover thumped his tail on the ground, perhaps to show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
that he would be good and mind.
</p>
<p>
“It’s nice and warm in here,” Freddie remarked,
after a while. “I wish we could stay
here longer, Flossie.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“Not if we want to go to Mrs. Bimby’s,”
Freddie answered. “We have to get out and
walk some more. And it’s snowing again, too.”
</p>
<p>
Whether it was or not, the children could
not be quite certain, for the wind was blowing,
and if the flakes were not falling from the sky
they were blowing up off the ground.
</p>
<p>
It was almost the same, anyhow, for there
was a fine shower of the cold, white flakes in
the air, and it was much more cosy and warm
under the tree than out in the open.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s stay here a little longer,” begged
Flossie. “Rover likes it here, don’t you?” she
asked, as she reached out her hand and patted
the shaggy back of the dog.
</p>
<p>
And from the manner in which Rover
thumped his tail on the ground you could tell
that he did, indeed, like to be with the little
Bobbsey twins under the shelter of the tree.
</p>
<p>
“I know what we can do,” said Freddie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
after thinking a moment. “I know what we
can do to have some fun!”
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked Flossie, always ready for
anything of this sort.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll throw a lot of these pine cones outside,
and Rover will chase after ’em and bring
’em back,” went on Freddie. “He likes to run
out in the snow. And after we play that awhile
maybe it will be nicer outside.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” agreed Flossie. “We’ll throw
pine cones.”
</p>
<p>
There were many of these on the pine-needle
covered ground beneath the sheltering tree.
The cones were really the clusters of seeds
from the tree, and they had become hard and
dry so they made excellent things to throw
for a dog to bring back.
</p>
<p>
Rover liked to race after sticks when thrown
by the children, and the pine cones were ever
so much better than sticks. There were so
many of them, too.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll throw first, and then it will be your
turn, Flossie,” Freddie said. “Here, Rover!”
he called to the dog, as he picked up several
of the cones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
Always ready for a lark of this sort, Rover
leaped to his feet and stood at “attention.”
Freddie bent aside some of the branches and
tossed a pine cone out of the opening.
</p>
<p>
It fell in a bank of snow some distance
away, for Freddie was a good thrower for a
little boy. And the pine cone, being light, did
not sink down in the snow as a stone would
have done.
</p>
<p>
“Bow-wow!” barked Rover, as he dashed
out after the pine cone.
</p>
<p>
That was his way of saying he would bring
it back as quickly as he could. And as Rover
rushed from under the little green tent of the
pine tree Flossie gave a cry of surprise.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked Freddie, turning
around to look at his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Rover knocked me down!” she answered
with a laugh, and, surely enough, there she
was sprawling on the brown pine needles which
covered the ground under the tree. “He just
bunked into me and knocked me over!”
</p>
<p>
Rover was not used to playing with children,
you see, and he was a bit rough. But he didn’t
mean to be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
Flossie sat up, still laughing, for she was not
in the least hurt, and by this time Rover had
brought back the pine cone that Freddie had
tossed out.
</p>
<p>
“Good dog, Rover!” cried Freddie, patting
the animal as he laid down the cone and wagged
his tail. “Now it’s your turn to throw one,
Flossie,” Freddie said.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” Flossie answered. “But look
out he doesn’t knock you down, Freddie.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m looking out!” Freddie said, and he
quickly moved over to one side of the space
under the tree, while Flossie threw out her
cone.
</p>
<p>
Flossie was not quite so good a thrower of
sticks, stones, or pine cones as was her brother.
But she did pretty well. Though her cone did
not go as far as Freddie’s had, it sank farther
down into the snow. Maybe the cone was a
heavier one, or it may have fallen in a softer
place in the snow. Anyhow it went quite deep
into a drift and Rover had to dig with his forepaws
to get it so he could take it in his mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, look at him!” cried Flossie, as the
dog, digging away, made the snow fly in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
shower back of him. “He’s like a snowplow
on the railroad!”
</p>
<p>
Once, in a big storm, Flossie and Freddie
had seen the railroad snowplow, pushed by
two locomotives, cut through a high drift.
And the way Rover scattered the snow made
the little girl think of the plow.
</p>
<p>
“Bring it here, Rover!” cried Freddie, for
it would be his turn next to throw a cone.
</p>
<p>
“Bow-wow!” barked the dog, and then, with
a final dive into the drift, he got the brown
cone in his mouth and came racing back with
it. Covered with snow as he was, he crawled
under the shelter to be petted and talked kindly
to by Freddie and Flossie.
</p>
<p>
Then, just as he probably did when he came
out of the water in the summer time, Rover
gave himself a shake, to get rid of the snowflakes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh!” laughed Flossie, holding her
hands over her face. “Stop it, Rover! You’re
getting me all snow!”
</p>
<p>
But Rover kept it up until he had got off all
the snow, and then he raced out again after
more cones as the children threw them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
If Bert Bobbsey could have known where
his little sister and brother were, with brave
old Rover beside them, I am sure he would
have wished to join them. For Bert, about
this time, was running away from the wildcat
that had suddenly burst through the bushes.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not going to get me!” said Bert to
himself, as he clutched his package of lunch and
raced on as well as he could.
</p>
<p>
The pain in his leg bothered him, but he
was not going to stop for a thing like that and
let a wildcat maul him. On he ran through
the snow, taking the easiest path he could find.
He looked back over his shoulder once or twice,
to find the wildcat bounding lightly along after
him.
</p>
<p>
And after he had looked back and had seen
the size of the animal and noticed that there
was only one, somehow or other Bert became
braver, and he had an idea that perhaps he
might drive this beast away.
</p>
<p>
Wildcats, or bobcats as they are sometimes
called, being also known as the bay lynx, are
not as large as a good-sized dog. They weigh
about thirty pounds, and though they have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
sharp teeth and claws they very seldom attack
persons. Only when they are disturbed, or
fear that someone is going to harm their little
ones or take away their food, do bobcats run
after persons.
</p>
<p>
And this one must have thought Bert was
going to do it some harm, for the animal certainly
chased the lad.
</p>
<p>
“Ho!” said Bert to himself, as he looked
back, “you’re not so big! Maybe you have got
sharp teeth and claws, but if you don’t get near
me you can’t hurt me! I’m going to make
you go back!”
</p>
<p>
Bert had a sudden idea of how he might do
this—with snowball bullets. All about him
was snow—piles of it—and Bert had often
taken part in snowball fights at home. He was
a good thrower, and once he had snowballed a
savage dog that had run at Flossie and Freddie
and had caused the animal to run yelping away.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to snowball this wildcat!” decided
Bert.
</p>
<p>
He ran on a little farther until he came to
a small clearing where the trees stood in an
irregular ring around an open place. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
Bert decided to make a stand and see if he
could not drive the chasing wildcat away.
</p>
<p>
“And if he won’t go, and comes after me,”
thought Bert, “I can climb a tree.”
</p>
<p>
He did not know, or else had forgotten, that
wildcats themselves are very good tree-climbers.
</p>
<p>
Reaching the other side of the clearing, Bert
laid his package of lunch down on a firm place
in the snow, and then rapidly began to make
some hard, round balls. He packed them with
all his might between his mittened hands, for
he knew a soft snowball would not be of much
use against a wildcat.
</p>
<p>
He had been some distance ahead of the animal,
and when it ran up to the edge of the
clearing Bert had several snowballs ready.
</p>
<p>
“Come on now! See how you like that!”
cried the boy. He threw one snowball “bullet,”
but he was so excited that it went high over
the head of the bobcat. The next one struck
in the snow at the feet of the animal. But the
third one hit it right on the nose!
</p>
<p>
“Good shot!” cried Bert.
</p>
<p>
The wildcat uttered a snarl and a growl, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
stopped for a moment. Perhaps it had never
before chased anyone who threw snowballs.
</p>
<p>
“Have another!” cried Bert, and the next
white bullet struck it on the side. The bobcat
leaped up in the air, and then Bert threw another
ball which hit it on the head.
</p>
<p>
This was too much for the creature. With
a loud howl it turned and ran back into the
woods, and Bert breathed easier.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess as long as I can throw snowballs
you won’t get me,” he said to himself, as
he picked up the package of lunch and hurried
on.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—ON THE ROCK</h2>
<p>
Bert Bobbsey felt very proud of himself
after he had driven away the wildcat with
snowballs. And I think he had a right to be
proud. Not many boys of his age would have
dared to stand and await the oncoming of a
beast that is quite dangerous once it starts to
claw and bite. But Bert had spent so much
time in the woods and out in the open that he
was very self-reliant.
</p>
<p>
And so, after looking back once or twice as
he left the clearing, and finding that the bobcat
did not follow, Bert began to feel much better.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll soon be at Cedar Camp,” he said to
himself, “and then I’ll be all right. I’ll send
’em back to get Nan and take something to
eat to Mrs. Bimby. I’ll be glad to see Flossie
and Freddie again.”
</p>
<p>
Had Bert only known it, Flossie and Freddie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
were nearer to him than if they had been in
Cedar Camp, though the small Bobbsey twins
were still some distance from their brother.
</p>
<p>
And while Mr. Bobbsey was forging ahead
through the snow with Old Jim Bimby and
Tom Case, knowing nothing, of course, about
his little boy and girl having followed him,
Mrs. Bobbsey was having worries of her own
about the absence of the small children from
the cabin.
</p>
<p>
She and Mrs. Baxter had missed Flossie and
Freddie soon after the men had started on the
searching trip, but, for a time, the mother of
the two small twins was not at all worried. She
thought Flossie and Freddie had merely run
out to play a little, as it was the first chance
they had had since the big storm began.
</p>
<p>
But when, after a while, they had not come
back to the cabin, and she could see nothing
of them, Mrs. Bobbsey said:
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Baxter, have you seen Flossie and
Freddie?”
</p>
<p>
“No, Mrs. Bobbsey, I haven’t,” answered
the cook. “But it looks as if they had been
in the pantry, for things there are all upset.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bobbsey looked around the kitchen and
pantry, and she at once guessed part of what
had happened.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve packed up lunch for themselves,”
she said to the housekeeper, “and they’ve gone
out to play. Well, they’ll be all right as long
as they stay around here and it doesn’t storm
again. I’ll go and look for them in a few minutes.”
</p>
<p>
But when she did look and call Flossie
and Freddie, they were not to be found. Indeed,
they were more than a mile away by this
time, and they had just met Rover, as I have
told you.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad Rover’s with us, aren’t you, Freddie?”
asked Flossie, as they made ready to set
off again, after having eaten their lunch.
</p>
<p>
“Lots glad,” answered the little boy. “Mrs.
Bimby will be glad to see him, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed Mrs. Bimby, left alone with Nan
after Bert had gone out, would have been glad
to see almost anyone. For she was worried
because her husband was away and because
there was so little left in the house to eat, only
she did not want to tell Nan so. And she did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
not think she could shoot another rabbit, as
Bert had done.
</p>
<p>
“I do hope that boy will find my Jim or
someone and bring help,” thought Mrs. Bimby.
</p>
<p>
And of course Mr. Bobbsey with Old Jim
and Tom Case were on their way to the cabin,
but they had to go slowly on account of so much
snow.
</p>
<p>
The snow was worse for Flossie and Freddie
than for any of the others in the woods, because
the legs of the small twins were so short.
It was hard work for them to wade through
the drifts. But they felt a little better after
their rest under the “Christmas tree,” as Flossie
called it, and after they had eaten some of their
lunch. So on they trudged again.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we can find daddy’s lost Christmas
trees,” suggested Freddie, after a while.
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t he be glad if we did?” cried
Flossie. “Here, Rover! Come back!” she
called, for the dog was running too far ahead
to please her and Freddie.
</p>
<p>
The dog came racing back, scattering the
snow about as he plunged through it, and
Flossie patted his shaggy head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think we’ll find daddy pretty
soon?” asked Flossie, after she and Freddie
had trudged on for perhaps half an hour
longer. “I’m getting tired in my legs.”
</p>
<p>
“So’m I,” her brother admitted. “I wish
we could find ’em. But if we don’t, pretty
soon, we’ll go back, ’cause I think it’s going to
snow some more.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the sky seemed to be getting darker
behind the veil of snow clouds that hung over
it, and some swirling flakes of white began
sifting down.
</p>
<p>
Freddie came to a stop and looked about
him. He was tired, and so was Flossie. The
only one of the party who seemed to enjoy
racing about in the drifts was Rover. He
never appeared to get tired.
</p>
<p>
“I guess maybe we’d better go back,” said
Freddie, after thinking it over. “We haven’t
much left to eat, and I guess daddy can tell
Mrs. Bimby about the bear skin to keep her
warm.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess so,” agreed Flossie. “It’s going to
be night pretty soon.”
</p>
<p>
It would be some hours until night, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
and the darkness was caused by gathering storm
clouds, but Flossie and Freddie did not know
that. They turned about, and began to go
back along the way they had come. At least
they thought they were doing that, but they
had not gone far before Flossie said:
</p>
<p>
“Freddie, we’ve come the wrong way.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“’Cause we aren’t stepping in our own tracks
like we would be if we went back straight.”
</p>
<p>
Freddie looked at the snow. It was true.
There was no sign of the tracks they must have
made in walking along. Before this they had
known which way they were going. Now they
didn’t.
</p>
<p>
“We—we’re lost!” faltered Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, maybe not,” said Freddie as cheerfully
as he could. But still, when he realized that
they had not walked along their back track, he
knew they must be going farther into the
woods, or at least away from Cedar Camp.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t like to be lost!” wailed Flossie.
“I want to go home!”
</p>
<p>
Freddie did too, but he hoped he wouldn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
cry about it. Boys must be brave and not cry,
he thought.
</p>
<p>
But as the little Bobbsey twins stood there,
not knowing what to do, it suddenly became
colder, the wind sprang up, and down came a
blinding storm of snow, so thick that they could
not see Rover, who, a moment before, had been
tumbling about in the drifts near them.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh!” cried Flossie. “Let’s go home,
Freddie!”
</p>
<p>
But where was “home” or camp? How
were they to get there?
</p>
<p>
And so, soon after Bert had driven off the
wildcat and had run on, this Bobbsey lad, too,
was caught in the same snow storm that had
frightened Flossie and Freddie. But of course
Bert did not know that.
</p>
<p>
“Say, we’ve had enough snow for a winter
and a half already,” thought Bert, as he saw
more white flakes coming down. “And it isn’t
Christmas yet! I hope I’m not going to be
snowed in out here all alone! I’d better
hurry!”
</p>
<p>
As Bert trudged along through the storm
he found himself becoming thirsty. If you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
have ever walked a long distance, even in a
snowstorm, you may have felt the same way
yourself. And perhaps you have tried to
quench your thirst and cool your mouth by
eating snow. If you have, you doubtless remember
that instead of getting less thirsty you
were only made more so. This is what always
happens when a person eats snow. Ice is
different, if you hold pieces of it in your mouth
until it melts.
</p>
<p>
“My! I wish I had a drink,” exclaimed
Bert, speaking aloud, as he had done a number
of times since setting out alone to bring help
to Nan and Mrs. Bimby. “I wish I had a
drink of water!”
</p>
<p>
Now Bert Bobbsey knew better than to eat
dry snow. Once when he was a small boy,
smaller even than Freddie, he had been playing
out in the snow and had eaten it whenever he
felt thirsty. As a result he had been made ill.
</p>
<p>
“Never eat snow again, Bert,” his father
had told him at the time. And to make Bert
remember Mr. Bobbsey had read the boy a
story of travelers in the Arctic regions searching
for the North Pole. The story told how,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
no matter how tired or cold these travelers
were, they always stopped to melt the snow
and make water or tea of it when they were
thirsty. They never ate dry snow.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve either got to find a spring to get a
drink, or melt some of this snow,” said Bert
to himself, as he walked on, limping a little,
though his leg was feeling better than at first.
“But I guess if I did find a spring it would be
frozen over. Now how can I melt some
snow?”
</p>
<p>
Bert had been on camping trips with his
father, and he had often seen Mr. Bobbsey
make use of things he found beside the road
or in the woods to help out in a time of some
little trouble. With this in mind, the boy began
to look around for something that would
help him get a drink of water, or to melt some
snow into water which he could drink after
it had cooled.
</p>
<p>
But to melt snow needed a fire, he knew,
and also something that would hold the snow
before and after it was melted.
</p>
<p>
“I need a pan or a can and a fire,” decided
Bert. “I wonder if I have any matches?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p>
He felt in his pockets and found some,
though he did not usually carry them, for they
are rather dangerous for children. But Bert
felt that he was now getting to be quite a boy.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here’s a start,” he said to himself as
he felt the matches in his pocket. But he did
not take them out, for the snow was blowing
about, and Bert knew that a wet match was as
bad as none at all. He must keep his matches
dry as the old settlers were advised to “keep
their powder dry.”
</p>
<p>
“If I could only make a fire,” thought Bert,
coming to a stop and looking about him at a
spot that looked as if it might once have been
a camp. All he could see was a waste of snow
and some trees. But wood for fires, he knew,
grew on trees, though any wood which could
be made to burn must be dry.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe I could scrape away some snow and
make a fire,” thought Bert. “The thing I need
most, though, is a tin can to hold snow and
water. Ouch! My leg hurts!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
His leg, just then, seemed to get a “kink” in
it, as he said afterward. He kicked out, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
football players do sometimes when their legs
get twisted.
</p>
<p>
As it happened, Bert kicked his foot into
a little pile of snow, and next he was surprised
to find that he had kicked something out. At
first it seemed to be a lump of ice, but as it
rolled a few feet and the snow fell away, the
boy found that he had kicked into view an
empty tin tomato can!
</p>
<p>
“Here’s luck!” cried Bert, as he sprang after
the can before it could be covered from sight
in the snow again. “This sure is luck! I can
melt some snow in this now!”
</p>
<p>
Taking the can in his hand he knocked it
against his shoe, thus getting rid of the snow
that filled it. The can was opened half way,
and the tin top was bent back, making a sort
of handle to it, which Bert was glad to see.
It would enable him without burning his fingers
to lift the can off the fire he intended to
build.
</p>
<p>
“All I need now is some dry wood, and I
can make a fire and melt snow to make water,”
he said aloud. “If I had some tea I could
make a regular hot drink, like they have up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
at the North Pole. But I guess water will be
all right. Now for some wood!”
</p>
<p>
He made his way over to a clump of trees
and, by kicking away the snow, he managed
to find some dead sticks. As the snow was
dry they were not very wet, but Bert feared
they were not dry enough to kindle quickly.
And he had only a few matches.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got some paper, though,” he told himself,
as lie felt in his pockets. “A little soft,
dry wood, and that, will start a fire and the
other wood will burn, even if it is a little
damp.”
</p>
<p>
One of the lessons Bert’s father had taught
him was to make a campfire, and Bert put
some of this instruction to use now. He
hunted about until he found a fallen log, and
by clearing away the snow at one end he revealed
a rotten end. This soft wood made
very good tinder, to start a fire.
</p>
<p>
The outer end of the rotten log was rather
damp. But by kicking away this latter, Bert
got at some wood that was quite dry—just
what he wanted.
</p>
<p>
He swung his foot that was not lame from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
side to side, clearing a place on the ground at
one side of the log, and there he laid his paper
and the wood to start his fire.
</p>
<p>
You may be sure Bert was very anxious as
he struck one of his few matches and held it
to the paper. He hardly breathed as he
watched the tiny flame. And then, all at once,
the blaze flickered out after it had caught one
edge of the paper!
</p>
<p>
“This is bad luck!” murmured Bert. “I’ve
got a few more chances, though.”
</p>
<p>
He crumpled up the paper in a different
shape, arranged it carefully under the pile of
splinters and rotten wood, and struck another
match. This time he made sure to hold in his
breath completely, for it was his breath before,
he feared, that had blown out the match.
</p>
<p>
This time the paper caught and blazed up
merrily. Bert wanted to shout and cry “hurrah!”
but he did not. The fire was not really
going yet, and he was getting more and more
thirsty all the while. It was all he could do
not to scoop up some of the dry snow and
cram it into his mouth. But he held back.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have some water melted in a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
while,” he told himself. “My fire is going
now.”
</p>
<p>
And, indeed, the tiny flame had caught the
soft wood and was beginning to ignite the
twigs. From them the larger and heavier
pieces of wood would catch, and then he could
set the can of snow on to melt into water.
</p>
<p>
Still hardly daring to breathe, Bert fed his
fire in the shelter of the half snow-covered
log. It was beginning to melt the snow all
around it now, but of course this melted snow
ran away and was lost. Bert could not drink
that.
</p>
<p>
When the fire was going well, Bert kicked
around on the ground under the log until he
found some stones. With these he made a
little fireplace, enclosing the blaze, and when he
had some embers there, with more wood at
hand to pile on, he brought the can to the fire
and scooped the tin full of snow.
</p>
<p>
“This is going to be my teakettle,” said
Bert, with a little smile. “Mother and Nan
would laugh if they could see me now.”
</p>
<p>
If you have ever melted a pan of snow on
even so good a fire as is in your mother’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
kitchen range, you know that snow melts very
slowly. It was this way with Bert. He thought
the snow in the can would never melt down
into water, and when it did, and was fairly
boiling, he took hold of the top and threw all
the water out!
</p>
<p>
Why did he do that? you ask. Well, because
he wanted to be sure the can was clean,
and his mother had told him that boiling water
would destroy almost any kind of germ. The
can might have had germs in it, having lain
outdoors a long time.
</p>
<p>
“But now I guess it’s clean,” Bert said, as
he again filled it with snow after he had rinsed
it out. Then he waited for the second quantity
of snow to melt, and when this had cooled,
which did not take very long, Bert took a drink.
The snow water did not taste very good—boiled
water very seldom does—but it was
safer than eating dry snow.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now I must travel on,” said Bert, as
he scattered snow over the fire to put it out.
“I’ll carry a little water with me in the can,
for I may get thirsty again. It won’t freeze
for a while.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
He walked along as fast as he could, with
the pain in his leg, but the snow came down
harder and faster and the wind blew colder.
Bert looked about for some place of shelter
and saw where one tree had blown over against
another, making a sort of little den, or cave,
near the side of a high rock, which was so
steep that the snow had not clung to it, leaving
the big stone bare.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go in there and stay awhile,” thought
Bert, as he caught sight of this shelter. “Maybe
the storm won’t last long.”
</p>
<p>
But as he started to enter the place he heard
a growl! There was a scurrying in the dried
leaves that formed a carpet for the den, and
then, in the half-darkness, Bert saw two green
eyes staring at him! He smelled a wild odor,
too, that told him some beast of the forest
dwelt in this den.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! A wildcat!” cried Bert, as, a moment
later, there sprang out at him the same animal,
or one very like it, that he had snowballed a
little while before. Probably it was another
lynx, but Bert did not stop to think of this.
</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>
Forgetting his plan of using snowball bullets,
Bert dropped his little bundle of lunch,
part of which he had eaten, and began to climb
the nearest tree.
</p>
<p>
He learned then, if he did not know it before,
that a wildcat, which was the animal he
had surprised in its den, is a good tree-climber;
as good as your house cat, or even better.
</p>
<p>
When half way up the tree, Bert looked
down and saw the yellow wildcat coming after
him. Probably the animal thought that Bert
had no right near its den.
</p>
<p>
“This is bad!” thought Bert, as he climbed
higher and higher. Then, as he saw the beast
still coming, he realized that he must, somehow,
get away. He saw the big rock not far from
the tree. The rock had a small flat top, covered
with snow, but the sides were smooth and
almost straight up and down, and had no snow
on them.
</p>
<p>
“If I could get there the wildcat couldn’t
get me,” thought Bert. “And if it tries to
jump after me I can snowball it. I’m going
to get on the rock!”
</p>
<p>
It was the best plan he could think of, and
a moment later, having got in good position,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
he gave a jump, left the tree, and landed in the
soft snow on top of the big rock.
</p>
<p>
With a snarl and a growl the wildcat stopped
climbing up as it saw what the boy had done.
Then it began climbing down the tree while
Bert, from his place of safety, watched. He
wondered what the bobcat would do.
</p>
<p>
The animal walked over to where Bert had
dropped his package of lunch and began tearing
at the paper.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe if he eats that he won’t want to get
me,” thought Bert. “But how long shall I have
to stay here?”
</p>
<p>
The wildcat, having eaten Bert’s lunch, which
did not take long, looked up at the boy on the
rock. It sniffed at the base of the big stone,
and reared up with its forepaws against it.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t climb here!” called Bert aloud.
“If you do I’ll hit you on the nose with snowballs!”
</p>
<p>
And then, as though to add to the boy’s
troubles, it began to snow hard, a wall of white
flakes falling around the lone laddie on the
big rock.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—FOUND AT LAST</h2>
<p>
Bert Bobbsey was really frightened and
alarmed, caught as he was in the storm on the
big rock, with a wildcat sniffing around at the
bottom. He could not even see well enough
to throw snowballs at the creature, and, even
if he could have driven it away, he felt that
it would not be safe for him to come down
off the big stone.
</p>
<p>
“He can’t get me while I’m up here, I don’t
believe,” said Bert to himself. “But I can’t
stay here very long, or I’ll be snowed under.
What shall I do?”
</p>
<p>
Indeed he was in what he said afterward
was a “regular pickle.” And then Bert thought
of calling for help. He wondered why he
had not done that before.
</p>
<p>
Standing up on the high rock Bert sent his
voice shouting out into the storm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help! Help!” he shouted.
</p>
<p>
Bert did not know just whom he expected
to help him. He did not know how far he was
from Mrs. Bimby’s cabin, nor how far he was
away from Cedar Camp. All he knew was
that he was in trouble and needed help. The
only way was to shout as loudly as he could.
</p>
<p>
At his first call the wildcat at the foot of
the rock snarled, growled, and tried to leap
up. But the sides were too steep and smooth.
Bert could catch glimpses of the animal when
the snow came down a little less heavily now
and again, making a sort of opening in the
white curtain.
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help! Help!” cried Bert again
and again.
</p>
<p>
Curiously enough it was Flossie and Freddie,
who in the blizzard had wandered near
to the rock, who heard Bert’s cry. Through
the storm the voice came to them, though of
course they did not know it was their brother
calling.
</p>
<p>
“Hark!” exclaimed Freddie, who, with his
sister, had been floundering about in the drifts,
the small Bobbsey twins trying to find their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
former tracks in the snow so they could work
their way back. But the flakes had fallen into
their footprints, and had been blown over them
so deeply that the prints were blotted out.
</p>
<p>
“Do you hear that?” asked Freddie of
Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she answered, as the voice came to
her ears. “It’s somebody saying he’ll help us.”
</p>
<p>
That is what she thought it was—someone
wanting to help her and Freddie, not someone
in need of help.
</p>
<p>
Again came the call, and it sounded so close
that the two small Bobbsey twins knew which
way to go to reach it.
</p>
<p>
“We’re coming! We’re coming!” shouted
Freddie. “Come on, Rover! I guess that’s
daddy coming to help us! We’re coming!”
</p>
<p>
With a bark the dog bounded through the
storm after the two children, and you can imagine
how surprised Bert Bobbsey on the rock
was when he heard shouts in answer to his
own. He did not know, of course, that Freddie
and Flossie were anywhere near him. He
thought it was his father and some of the men
from Cedar Camp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
A little later the small Bobbsey twins came
within sight of the big rock. They could not
see Bert on it on account of the blinding snow.
But Rover caught the smell of the wildcat, and
with a savage bark he sprang to drive the
creature away.
</p>
<p>
“Good old Rover! Good dog!” cried Bert,
as the snow stopped for a moment and he
caught sight of the dog that he knew. “Sic
him, Rover!”
</p>
<p>
And Rover rushed at the wildcat with such
fierceness that the beast scuttled back to its
den under the half-fallen tree. And then Bert
looked and saw Flossie and Freddie.
</p>
<p>
At the same time the small Bobbsey twins
looked up and caught a glimpse of their brother
on the rock.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Bert!” cried Freddie, “did you come
out to look for us? We’re lost!”
</p>
<p>
“So am I, I guess,” Bert answered, as he
jumped down, landing in a bank of soft snow
and beginning to pet Rover. “Where in the
world did you children come from?”
</p>
<p>
“We came out after daddy and Mr. Jim and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
Mr. Case,” Freddie went on. “They’re going
to take some things to Mrs. Bimby.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Bimby!” cried Bert “Why, I left
her and Nan this morning. They haven’t got
hardly anything left to eat. But where is the
camp?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know?” asked Freddie. “We
don’t know. We’re lost.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s bad,” said Bert, looking at the
swirling snow all about. “And the wildcat ate
my lunch.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve a little left,” Flossie said. “Did
you save any chestnuts, Bert?”
</p>
<p>
“I brought some, but I ate ’em. But Nan’s
got some, back at Mrs. Bimby’s cabin, if we
can find it. You say daddy started out after
us?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, to find you and Nan and take something
to Mrs. Bimby,” explained Freddie.
“Her husband was at our camp. He got lost
in the snow, and he said his wife didn’t have
anything in the cupboard.”
</p>
<p>
“She didn’t—not very much,” Bert said. “I
shot a rabbit, but I guess that’s all eaten now.
But say, you two oughtn’t to be out here alone!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’re not alone now,” Flossie said. “We
got you with us!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m glad you met me,” Bert said.
“And I’m glad Rover drove that wildcat away.
I scared one with snowballs, but I couldn’t hit
this one very well. Now we’d better try to
get back to camp. I guess there’s going to be
another storm.”
</p>
<p>
“Will it snow a whole lot and cover us all
up?” asked Flossie, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
The poor little girl had had quite enough of
snow, cold wind, blizzards, and bad weather
of all sorts.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I guess maybe it won’t snow so very
hard,” answered Bert. He did not want to
confess to Flossie and Freddie that he was a
bit frightened.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe Rover could show us which way to
go to find Cedar Camp,” suggested Freddie.
“Dogs are smart, and Rover is a good dog.”
</p>
<p>
“He was nice to us when we sat under the
pine tree,” went on Flossie. “And he ran out
and brought in pine cones and he shook himself
and made snow fly all over me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t try to eat pine cones, did you?”
asked Bert.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” Flossie answered. “We just
threw them for Rover to play with. But I’m
too tired to play now. I want to go to bed.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Flossie, you don’t want to go to bed
now, do you?” asked Bert. “Why, if you were
to lie down in the snow you’d freeze.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to go to sleep in the snow,”
Flossie said, and she was beginning to whine
a little. No wonder, for it had been a hard
day for her and Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t want to sleep in the snow,” the
little girl said. “I want my own little bunk
at the camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll be there pretty soon,” Bert
said, as kindly as he could.
</p>
<p>
“Carry me!” begged Flossie, when she had
stumbled on a little farther, walking between
her two brothers.
</p>
<p>
“All right. I guess I can carry you,” said
Bert, but he was worrying about his leg a little.
It was not so bad when he bore his own weight
on it. But could he carry Flossie?
</p>
<p>
However, he was not going to give up without trying,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
and so, when they came to a little
sheltered place, where the snow was not quite
so deep, Bert stooped down.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take you pickaback, Flossie,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I like that!” laughed his sister, as she
climbed up on her brother’s back.
</p>
<p>
Bert was not sure whether or not he was
going to like it, but he said nothing. He had
to shut his teeth tight to keep from crying out
with pain as he straightened up with Flossie
on his back, for her weight, small as she was,
put too much weight on his injured leg. Flossie
was quite “chunky” for her size, as Dinah
was wont to say.
</p>
<p>
“Hold steady now, Flossie,” directed Bert,
as he straightened up. “Put your arms around
my neck.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I know how to ride piggy-back!”
laughed Flossie. She was not so tired now,
when something like this happened to change
her thoughts.
</p>
<p>
Bert staggered along through the snow with
his sister on his back. Though he did not want
to say so, his leg hurt him very much. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
tried not to limp, though Freddie at last noticed
it, and asked:
</p>
<p>
“Have you got a stone in your shoe, Bert?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, I—I just sprained it a little,” Bert
answered in a low voice, so Flossie would not
hear. For of course if she had known it hurt
her brother to carry her she would not ask him
to. But just then Flossie was reaching up to
take hold of a branch of a tree as Bert passed
beneath it. And, catching hold of it, Flossie,
with a merry laugh, showered herself and Bert
with snow that clung to the branch.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t, Flossie, dear!” Bert had to say.
“There’s snow enough without pulling down
any more. And we’ll get plenty if the clouds
spill more flakes.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think it will storm some more?”
Freddie wanted to know.
</p>
<p>
Bert did not answer right away. He was
thinking what he could do about Flossie. If
she could not walk then she must be carried,
but he felt that he could not hold her on his
back much longer, his leg was paining too
much.
</p>
<p>
Just then the sight of Rover, the big, strong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
dog, floundering about in the snow, gave Bert
an idea. Rover did not seem to care how much
breath or strength he wasted, for he ran everywhere,
barking and trying to dig things out
from under the drifts.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Flossie! wouldn’t you like to ride on
Rover’s back?” asked poor, tired Bert.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that will be lovely!” cried the little
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Here, Rover!” cried Freddie.
</p>
<p>
The dog came leaping through the snow, very
likely hoping to have some sticks thrown that
he might race after them. But he did not seem
surprised when Flossie was placed on his back
and held there by Freddie on one side and
Bert on the other.
</p>
<p>
“Now I’m having a ride on a make-believe
elephant!” laughed Flossie. Rover could not
run with the little girl on his back, and I must
say he behaved very nicely, carrying her along
through the drifts. Her legs hung “dangling
down-o,” but that did not matter.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I’m rested now,” said Flossie, after
a bit. “I’m cold, and it will make me warmer
to walk. I’ll walk and hold your hand, Bert.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
If Rover was glad to have the load taken
from his back he did not say so, but by the
way he raced on ahead when Flossie got off
I think he was.
</p>
<p>
“I guess there’s more snow coming,” suddenly
cried Bert.
</p>
<p>
There was, the flakes coming down almost
as thick and fast as when the blizzard first
swirled about Cedar Camp. Bert took the
hands of Flossie and Freddie and led them on
through the storm. It was hard work, and
the smaller children were crying with the cold
and from fear at the coming darkness when
Rover suddenly barked.
</p>
<p>
“Hark!” cried Bert. “I guess someone is
coming!”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s daddy!” half sobbed Flossie.
</p>
<p>
Shouts were coming through the storm—the
shouts of men. Rover barked louder and
rushed forward. Bert held to the hands of
his brother and sister and peered anxiously
through the falling flakes and the fast-gathering
darkness.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly a man rushed forward, and, a moment
later, had Flossie and Freddie in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
arms, hugging and kissing them. Then he
clasped Bert around the shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“Daddy! Daddy!” cried Flossie and Freddie
together. “You found us, didn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But I didn’t know you were away
from camp,” said Mr. Bobbsey, for it was he.
“Where’s Nan?” he asked Bert quickly, while
Rover leaped about his master, Mr. Case, and
Old Jim.
</p>
<p>
“She’s at Mrs. Bimby’s cabin,” Bert answered.
</p>
<p>
“My wife!” exclaimed Old Jim. “Is she—is
she all right?”
</p>
<p>
“She was when I came away this morning
to get help,” said Bert. “I shot a rabbit for
her and Nan. It was good, too. But I guess
she’ll need food now.”
</p>
<p>
“We have a lot for her,” said Tom Case.
“Rover, you rascal!” he went on, patting his
dog, “I wondered where you ran away to, but
it’s a good thing you found the children.”
</p>
<p>
“And he drove away the wildcat,” Bert announced.
</p>
<p>
It was a happy, joyful party in spite of the
storm, which was getting worse. Mr. Bobbsey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
and the two men with him had gotten off the
road that led to Old Jim’s cabin, and it was
because of that fact that they had found the
lost children.
</p>
<p>
“What had we better do?” asked Mr. Bobbsey,
when it was learned that Bert, Freddie
and Flossie had really suffered no harm from
being lost. “Should we go back to Cedar
Camp or to your cabin, Mr. Bimby?”
</p>
<p>
“The cabin is nearer,” said Tom Case. “If
you folks go there, with Jim to guide you, I’ll
back track to Cedar Camp and fetch a sled.
You can ride the Bobbsey twins home in that.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we’d better go to my cabin,” said
Old Jim. “We can make room for you, and
we’ll take the food with us.”
</p>
<p>
So this plan was decided on, Tom Case and
Rover going to Cedar Camp for the sled, while
Mr. Bobbsey, Mr. Bimby and the three children
trudged back to Mrs. Bimby’s cabin.
</p>
<p>
You can imagine how glad Nan and the old
woman were to see not only Bert but the
others.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I was afraid when it began to storm
again,” said Nan, as she hugged Flossie and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
Freddie. “But I never dreamed you two would
be out in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” said their father.
</p>
<p>
“You ought to see the bear skin we found!”
exclaimed Freddie, to change the subject. “It’s
going to be for Mrs. Bimby, to keep her warm.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless their hearts!” murmured Old Jim’s
wife. “I can keep warm all right, but it’s
hard to get food in a storm.”
</p>
<p>
However, there was plenty of that now, and
they all soon gathered about the table and had
a hot meal. The second storm was not as bad
as the first had been, and later that evening
up came a big sled, filled with straw and drawn
by powerful horses, and in it was Mrs. Bobbsey
and some of the men from Cedar Camp.
</p>
<p>
After a joyful reunion, in piled the Bobbsey
twins with their father and mother, and good-byes
were called to the Bimby family, who now
had food enough to last through many storms.
</p>
<p>
There was not much trouble getting to Cedar
Camp, though the road was so blocked with
snow that once the sled almost upset. But
before midnight the Bobbsey twins were back
in the cabin, all safe together once again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ve had a lot of adventures since we
came here,” said Bert, as they sat about the
cozy fire.
</p>
<p>
“Too many,” remarked his mother. “I don’t
know when I’ve been so worried, and it was
worse after Flossie and Freddie went away.”
</p>
<p>
“We won’t run away again,” promised the
small twins.
</p>
<p>
“Did you find your Christmas trees, Daddy?”
asked Nan.
</p>
<p>
“No, not yet,” he replied. “I guess they’re
lost, and we’ll have to cut more.”
</p>
<p>
But the next day, when the storm ceased
and the sun shone, a man came to camp with
word about the missing trees. The railroad
cars on which they were loaded had been
switched off on a wrong track and had been
held at a distant station awaiting someone to
claim them. This Mr. Bobbsey did, and soon
the shipment of Christmas trees was on its
way to Lakeport.
</p>
<p>
“And as long as they are found there is no
excuse for staying in Cedar Camp any longer,”
said Mr. Bobbsey.
</p>
<p>
But the children like it so that they prevailed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
on their father and mother to remain a few
days longer. And then the Bobbsey twins had
many good times, playing in the woods and
about the sawmill. For there came a thaw after
the big storms, and most of the snow melted.
Bert and Nan got more chestnuts, too.
</p>
<p>
“But I hope we’ll have some snow for Christmas,”
said Nan.
</p>
<p>
“So we can make a snow fort!” added
Freddie.
</p>
<p>
“And a snowman and knock his hat off!”
laughed Flossie.
</p>
<p>
“I should think you’d had enough snow,”
remarked their mother.
</p>
<p>
But the Bobbsey twins seldom had enough
of anything when there was fun and excitement
going, and you may be sure this was not
the last of their adventures. But now let us
say good-bye.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
